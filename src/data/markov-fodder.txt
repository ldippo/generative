Of course we don't build apps to run in plunker. The following steps establish a development environment for the documentation samples that also can be the foundation for our real world applications. At a high level, we will

set up the development environment
write the app's Angular root component
write main.ts which tells Angular to display the root component
write the host web page index.html

Development Environment

We need to set up our development environment:

install node and npm
create an application project folder
add a tsconfig.json to guide the TypeScript compiler
add a typings.json that identifies missing TypeScript definition files
add a package.json that defines the packages and scripts we need
install the npm packages and typings files
Install node and npm if not already on your machine.

Create a new project folder


mkdir angular2-quickstart
cd    angular2-quickstart

Add a tsconfig.json file to the project folder and copy/paste the following:

This tsconfig.json file guides the TypeScript compiler. Learn more about it in the TypeScript Configuration chapter.

Add a typings.json file to the project folder and copy/paste the following:

Many JavaScript libraries extend the JavaScript environment with features and syntax that the TypeScript compiler doesn't recognize natively. We teach it about these capabilities with TypeScript type definition files — d.ts files — which we identify in a typings.json file.

We go a little deeper into typings in the TypeScript Configuration chapter.

Add a package.json file to the project folder and copy/paste the following:

Adding the libraries we need with npm

Angular application developers rely on the npm package manager to install the libraries their apps require. The Angular team recommends the starter-set of packages specified in the dependencies and devDependencies sections. See the npm packages chapter for details.

Helpful scripts

We've included a number of npm scripts in our suggested package.json to handle common development tasks:

We execute most npm scripts in the following way: npm run + script-name. Some commands (such as start don't require the run keyword).

Here's what these scripts do:

npm start - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode"

npm run tsc - runs the TypeScript compiler once

npm run tsc:w - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them

npm run lite - runs the lite-server, a light-weight, static file server with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing

npm run typings - runs the typings tool

npm run postinstall - called by npm automatically after it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files defined in typings.json

Install these packages by entering the following npm command in a terminal window (command window in Windows):

Scary error messages in red may appear during install. The install typically recovers from these errors and finishes successfully.

npm errors and warnings

All is well if there are no console messages starting with npm ERR! at the end of npm install. There might be a few npm WARN messages along the way — and that is perfectly fine.

We often see an npm WARN message after a series of gyp ERR! messages. Ignore them. A package may try to re-compile itself using node-gyp. If the re-compile fails, the package recovers (typically with a pre-built version) and everything works.

Just make sure there are no npm ERR! messages at the end of npm install.

We're all set. Let's write some code.



Our First Angular Component

Let's create a folder to hold our application and add a super-simple Angular component.

Create an app sub-folder off the root directory and make it the current directory


mkdir app
cd    app
Add a component file named app.component.ts and paste the following lines:


AppComponent is the root of the application

Every Angular app has at least one root component, conventionally named AppComponent, that hosts the client user experience.

Components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. A component controls a portion of the screen — a view — through its associated template.

This QuickStart has only one, extremely simple component. But it has the essential structure of every component we'll ever write:

One or more import statements to reference the things we need.

A @Component decorator that tells Angular what template to use and how to create the component.

A component class that controls the appearance and behavior of a view through its template.


Import

Angular apps are modular. They consist of many files each dedicated to a purpose.

Angular itself is modular. It is a collection of library modules each made up of several, related features that we'll use to build our application.

When we need something from a module, we import it. Here we import the Angular Component decorator function from the main Angular library module because we need it to define our component.
Component is a decorator function that takes a metadata object. The metadata tell Angular how to create and use this component.

We apply this function to the component class by prefixing the function with the @ symbol and invoking it with the metadata object just above the class:

This particular metadata object has two fields, a selector and a template.

The selector specifies a simple CSS selector for an HTML element that represents the component.

The element for this component is named my-app. Angular creates and displays an instance of our AppComponent wherever it encounters a my-app element in the host HTML.

The template specifies the component's companion template, written in an enhanced form of HTML that tells Angular how to render this component's view.

Our template is a single line of HTML announcing "My First Angular App".

A more advanced template could contain data bindings to component properties and might identify other application components which have their own templates. These templates might identify yet other components. In this way an Angular application becomes a tree of components.


Component class

At the bottom of the file is an empty, do-nothing class named AppComponent.
When we're ready to build a substantive application, we can expand this class with properties and application logic. Our AppComponent class is empty because we don't need it to do anything in this QuickStart.

We export AppComponent so that we can import it elsewhere in our application, as we'll see when we create main.ts.


Show it with main.ts

Now we need something to tell Angular to load the root component

Add a new file , main.ts, to the app/ folder as follows:
We import the two things we need to launch the application:

Angular's browser bootstrap function
The application root component, AppComponent.
Then we call bootstrap with AppComponent.

Bootstrapping is platform-specific

Notice that we import the bootstrap function from angular2/platform/browser, not angular2/core.

Bootstrapping isn't core because there isn't a single way to bootstrap the app. True, most applications that run in a browser call the bootstrap function from this library.

But it is possible to load a component in a different environment. We might load it on a mobile device with Apache Cordova or NativeScript. We might wish to render the first page of our application on the server to improve launch performance or facilitate SEO.

These targets require a different kind of bootstrap function that we'd import from a different library.

Why create a separate main.ts file?

The main.ts file is tiny. This is just a QuickStart. We could have folded its few lines into the app.component file and spared ourselves some complexity.

We'd rather demonstrate the proper way to structure an Angular application. App bootstrapping is a separate concern from presenting a view. Mixing concerns creates difficulties down the road. We might launch the AppComponent in multiple environments with different bootstrappers. Testing the component is much easier if it doesn't also try to run the entire application. Let's make the small extra effort to do it the right way.

Add the index.html

The index.html is the web page that hosts the application

Navigate to the project root folder.

Create an index.html file in this root folder and paste the following lines:


There are three noteworthy sections of HTML

The JavaScript libraries

Configuration of SystemJS where we also import and run the main file that we just wrote.

The <my-app> tag in the <body> which is where our app lives!

Libraries

We loaded the following scripts

We began with Internet Explorer polyfills. IE requires polyfills to run an application that relies on ES2015 promises and dynamic module loading. Most applications need those capabilities and most applications should run in Internet Explorer.

Next are the polyfills for Angular2, angular2-polyfills.js.

Then the SystemJS library for module loading, followed by the Reactive Extensions RxJS library.

Our QuickStart doesn't use the Reactive Extensions but any substantial application will want them when working with observables. We added the library here in QuickStart so we don't forget later.

Finally, we loaded the web development version of Angular 2 itself.

We'll make different choices as we gain experience and become more concerned about production qualities such as load times and memory footprint.

SystemJS Configuration

The QuickStart uses SystemJS to load application and library modules. There are alternatives that work just fine including the well-regarded webpack. SystemJS happens to be a good choice but we want to be clear that it was a choice and not a preference.

All module loaders require configuration and all loader configuration becomes complicated rather quickly as soon as the file structure diversifies and we start thinking about building for production and performance.

We suggest becoming well-versed in the loader of your choice. Learn more about SystemJS configuration here.

With those cautions in mind, what are we doing in this QuickStart configuration?

The packages node tells SystemJS what to do when it sees a request for a module from the app/ folder.

Our QuickStart makes such requests when one of its application TypeScript files has an import statement like this:


Notice that the module name (after from) does not mention a filename extension. The packages: configuration tells SystemJS to default the extension to 'js', a JavaScript file.

That makes sense because we transpile TypeScript to JavaScript before running the application.

Transpiling in the browser

In the live example on plunker we transpile (AKA compile) to JavaScript in the browser on the fly. That's fine for a demo. That's not our preference for development or production.

We recommend transpiling (AKA compiling) to JavaScript during a build phase before running the application for several reasons including:

We see compiler warnings and errors that are hidden from us in the browser.

Pre-compilation simpifies the module loading process and it's much easier to diagnose problems when this is a separate, external step.

Pre-compilation means a faster user experience because the browser doesn't waste time compiling.

We iterate development faster because we only re-compile changed files. We notice the difference as soon as the app grows beyond a handful of files.

Pre-compilation fits into a continuous integration process of build, test, deploy.

The System.import call tells SystemJS to import the main file (main.js ... after transpiling main.ts, remember?). main is where we tell Angular to launch the application. We also catch and log launch errors to the console.

All other modules are loaded upon request either by an import statement or by Angular itself.

When Angular calls the bootstrap function in main.ts, it reads the AppComponent metadata, finds the my-app selector, locates an element tag named my-app, and loads our application between those tags.

Add some style

Styles aren't essential but they're nice and the index.html assumes we have a stylesheet called styles.css.

Create a styles.css in the root folder and start styling, perhaps with this set

Compile and run!

Open a terminal window and enter this command:


npm start
That command runs two parallel node processes

The TypeScript compiler in watch mode
A static server called lite-server that loads index.html in a browser and refreshes the browser when application files change
In a few moments, a browser tab should open and display

Congratulations! We are in business.

Make some changes

Try changing the message to "My SECOND Angular 2 app".

The TypeScript compiler and lite-server are watching. They should detect the change, recompile the TypeScript into JavaScript, refresh the browser, and display the revised message.

It's a nifty way to develop an application!

We close the terminal window when we're done to terminate both the compiler and the server.

Final structure

Our final project folder structure looks like this:

Wrap Up

Our first application doesn't do much. It's basically "Hello, World" for Angular 2.

We kept it simple in our first pass: we wrote a little Angular component, we added some JavaScript libraries to index.html, and launched with a static file server. That's about all we'd expect to do for a "Hello, World" app.

We have greater ambitions.

The good news is that the overhead of setup is (mostly) behind us. We'll probably only touch the package.json to update libraries. We'll likely open index.html only if we need to add a library or some css stylesheets.

We're about to take the next step and build a small application that demonstrates the great things we can build with Angular 2.

Join us on the Tour of Heroes Tutorial!

Angular 2 is a framework to help us build client applications in HTML and JavaScript.

The framework consists of several cooperating libraries, some of them core and some optional.

We write applications by composing HTML *templates* with Angularized-markup,
writing *component* classes to manage those templates, adding application logic in *services*,
and handing the top root component to Angular's *bootstrapper*.

Angular takes over, presenting our application content in a browser and responding to user interactions
according to the instructions we provided.

Of course there is more to it than this. We'll learn the details when we dive into the guide chapters.
Let's get the big picture first.


The architecture diagram identifies the eight main building blocks of an Angular 2 application:

Learn these eight and we're on our way.

Angular apps are modular.

In general we assemble our application from many **modules**.

A typical module is a cohesive block of code dedicated to a single purpose.
A module **exports** something of value in that code, typically one thing such as a class.

Modules are optional
We highly recommend modular design. TypeScript has great support for ES2015 module syntax and our chapters assume we're taking a modular
approach using that syntax. That's why we list *Module* among the basic building blocks.

 Angular itself doesn't require a modular approach nor this particular syntax. Don't use it if you don't want it.
 Each chapter has plenty to offer after you steer clear of the `import` and `export` statements.

Find setup and organization clues in the JavaScript track (select it from the combo-box at the top of this page)
which demonstrates Angular 2 development with plain old JavaScript and no module system.

Perhaps the first module we meet is a module that exports a *component* class.
The component is one of the basic Angular blocks, we write a lot of them,
and we'll talk about components in the next segment. For the moment it is enough to know that a
component class is the kind of thing we'd export from a module.

Most applications have an `AppComponent`. By convention, we'll find it in a file named `app.component.ts`.
Look inside such a file and we'll see an `export` statement like this one.

The `export` statement tells TypeScript that this is a module whose
`AppComponent` class is public and accessible to other modules of the application.

When we need a reference to the `AppComponent`, we **import** it like this:

The `import` statement tells the system it can get an `AppComponent` from a module named `app.component`
located in a neighboring file.
The **module name** (AKA module id) is often the same as the filename without its extension.

Library Modules

Some modules are libraries of other modules.

Angular itself ships as a collection of library modules called "barrels".
Each Angular library is actually a public façade over several logically related private modules.

The `angular2/core` library is the primary Angular library module from which we get most of what we need.

There are other important Angular library modules too such as `angular2/common`, `angular2/router`, and `angular2/http`.

 Learn more about how Angular organizes and distributes modules
 in "Modules, barrels and bundles".
We import what we need from an Angular library module in much the same way.
For example, we import the Angular **`Component` *function*** from the *angular2/core* module like this:

Compare that syntax to our previous import of `AppComponent`.

Notice the difference?
In the first case, when importing from an Angular library module,
the import statement refers to the bare module name, `angular2/core`, *without a path prefix*.

When we import from one of *our* own files, we prefix the module name with the file path.
In this example we specify  a relative file path (./). That means the
source module is in the same folder (./) as the module importing it.
We could path up and around the application folder structure if the source module were somewhere else.

We import and export in the ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015) module syntax.
Learn more about that syntax here
and many other places on the web.

The infrastructure *behind* module loading and importing is an important subject.
But it's a subject outside the scope of this introduction to Angular.
While we're focused on our application, *import* and *export*
is about all we need to know.

The key take-aways are:
* Angular apps are composed of modules.
* Modules export things &mdash; classes, function, values &mdash; that other modules import.
* We prefer to write our application as a collection of modules, each module exporting one thing.

The first module we write will most likely export a component.

The Component

A **Component** controls a patch of screen real estate that we could call a *view*.
The shell at the application root with navigation links, that list of heroes, the hero editor ...
they're all views controlled by Components.

We define a Component's application logic - what it does to support the view - inside a class.
The class interacts with the view through an API of properties and methods.

A `HeroListComponent`, for example, might have a `heroes` property that returns an array of heroes
that it acquired from a service.
It might have a `selectHero()` method that sets a `selectedHero` property when the user clicks on a hero from that list.
It might be a class like this:

Angular creates, updates, and destroys components as the user moves through the application.
The developer can take action at each moment in this lifecycle through optional Lifecycle Hooks.

We're not showing those hooks in this example
but we are making a mental note to find out about them later.

We may wonder who is calling that constructor? Who provides the service parameter?
For the moment, have faith that Angular will call the constructor and deliver an
appropriate `HeroService` when we need it.

The Template

We define a Component's view with its companion **template**. A template is a form of HTML
that tells Angular how to render the Component.

A template looks like regular HTML much of the time ... and then it gets a bit strange. Here is a
template for our `HeroList` component.


These are examples of Angular's template syntax.
We will grow accustomed to that syntax and may even learn to love it.
We'll begin to explain it in a moment.

Before we do, focus attention on the last line.
The `<hero-detail>` tag is a custom element representing the `HeroDetailComponent`.

The `HeroDetailComponent` is a *different* component than the `HeroListComponent` we've been reviewing.
The `HeroDetailComponent` (code not shown) presents facts about a particular hero, the
hero that the user selects from the list presented by the `HeroListComponent`.
The `HeroDetailComponent` is a **child** of the `HeroListComponent`.


Notice how `<hero-detail>` rests comfortably among the HTML elements we already know.
We can mix ... and will mix ... our custom components with native HTML in the same layouts.

And in this manner we can and will compose complex component trees to build out our richly featured application.

Angular Metadata

Looking back at the `HeroListComponent`, we see that it's just a class.
There is no evidence of a framework, no "Angular" in it at all.

In fact, it really is *just a class*. It's not a component until we *tell Angular about it*.

We tell Angular that `HeroListComponent` is a component by attaching **metadata** to the class.

The easy way to attach metadata in TypeScript is with a **decorator**.
Here's some metadata for `HeroListComponent`:

Here we see the `@Component` decorator which (no surprise) identifies the class
immediately below it as a Component class.

A decorator is a function. Decorators often have a configuration parameter.
The `@Component` decorator takes a required configuration object with the
information Angular needs to create and present the component and its view.


* `selector` - a css selector that tells Angular to create and insert an instance of this component
where it finds a `<hero-list>` tag in *parent* HTML.
If the template of the application shell (a Component) contained

Angular inserts an instance of the `HeroListComponent` view between those tags.

* `templateUrl` - the address of this component's template which we showed above.

* `directives` - an array of the Components or Directives that *this* template requires.
We saw in the last line of our template that we expect Angular to insert a `HeroDetailComponent`
in the space indicated by `<hero-detail>` tags.
Angular will do so only if we mention the `HeroDetailComponent` in this `directives` array.

* `providers` - an array of **dependency injection providers** for services that the component requires.
This is one way to tell Angular that our component's constructor requires a `HeroService`
so it can get the list of heroes to display. We'll get to dependency injection in a moment.

The `@Component` function takes the configuration object and turns it into metadata that it attaches
to the component class definition. Angular discovers this metadata at runtime and thus knows how to do "the right thing".

The template, metadata, and component together describe the view.

We apply other metadata decorators in a similar fashion to guide Angular behavior.
The `@Injectable`, `@Input`, `@Output`, `@RouterConfig` are a few of the more popular decorators
we'll master as our Angular knowledge grows.

The architectural take-away is that we must add metadata to our code
so that Angular knows what to do.

## Data Binding
Without a framework, we would be responsible for pushing data values into the HTML controls and turning user responses
into actions and value updates. Writing such push/pull logic by hand is tedious, error-prone and a nightmare to
read as the experienced jQuery programmer can attest.

Angular supports **data binding**,
a mechanism for coordinating parts of a template with parts of a component.
We add binding markup to the template HTML to tell Angular how to connect both sides.

There are four forms of data binding syntax. Each form has a direction - to the DOM, from the DOM, or in both directions -
as indicated by the arrows in the diagram.

We saw three forms of data binding in our example template:

  displays the component's `hero.name` property value within the `<div>` tags.

* The `[hero]` property binding passes the `selectedHero` from
the parent `HeroListComponent` to the `hero` property of the child `HeroDetailComponent`.

* The `(click)` event binding calls the Component's `selectHero` method when the user clicks
on a hero's name

**Two-way data binding** is an important fourth form
that combines property and event binding in a single notation using the `ngModel` directive.
We didn't have a two-way binding in the `HeroListComponent` template;
here's an example from the `HeroDetailComponent` template (not shown):

In two-way binding, a data property value flows to the input box from the component as with property binding.
The user's changes also flow back to the component, resetting the property to the latest value,
as with event binding.

Angular processes *all* data bindings once per JavaScript event cycle,
depth-first from the root of the application component tree.

We don't know all the details yet
but it's clear from these examples that data binding plays an important role in communication
between a template and its component ...
  ... ***and*** between parent and child components

The Directive

Our Angular templates are *dynamic*. When Angular renders them, it transforms the DOM
according to the instructions given by a **directive**.

A directive is a class with directive metadata. In TypeScript we'd apply the `@Directive` decorator
to attach metadata to the class.

We already met one form of directive: the component. A component is a *directive-with-a-template*
and the `@Component` decorator is actually a `@Directive` decorator extended with template-oriented features.

  While the **component is technically a directive**,
  it is so distinctive and central to Angular applications that we chose
  to separate the component from the directive in our architectural overview.

  There are two *other* kinds of directives as well that we call "structural" and "attribute" directives.

  They tend to appear within an element tag like attributes,
  sometimes by name but more often as the target of an assignment or a binding.

  **Structural** directives alter layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in DOM.

  We see two built-in structural directives at play in our example template:


**Attribute** directives alter the appearance or behavior of an existing element.
In templates they look like regular HTML attributes, hence the name.

The `ngModel` directive, which implements two-way data binding, is an example of an attribute directive.

It modifies the behavior of an existing element (typically an `<input>`)
by setting its display value property and responding to change events.

Angular ships with a few other directives that either alter the layout structure
or modify aspects of DOM elements and components

And of course we can write our own directives.

The Service

"Service" is a broad category encompassing any value, function or feature that our application needs.

Almost anything can be a service.
A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. It should do something specific and do it well.

Examples include:
* logging service
* data service
* message bus
* tax calculator
* application configuration

There is nothing specifically *Angular* about services. Angular itself has no definition of a *service*.
There is no *ServiceBase* class.

Yet services are fundamental to any Angular application.

Here's an example of a service class that logs to the browser console

Here's a `HeroService` that fetches heroes and returns them in a resolved promise.
The `HeroService` depends on the `LoggerService` and another `BackendService` that handles the server communication grunt work.

Services are everywhere.

Our components are big consumers of services. They depend upon services to handle most chores.
They don't fetch data from the server, they don't validate user input, they don't log directly to the console.
They delegate such tasks to services.

A component's job is to enable the user experience and nothing more. It mediates between the view (rendered by the template)
and the application logic (which often includes some notion of a "model").  A good component presents
properties and methods for data binding. It delegates everything non-trivial to services.

Angular doesn't *enforce* these principles.
It won't complain if we write a "kitchen sink" component with 3000 lines.

Angular does help us *follow* these principles by making it easy to factor our
application logic into services and make those services available to components through *dependency injection*.

Dependency Injection
"Dependency Injection" is a way to supply a new instance of a class
with the fully-formed dependencies it requires. Most dependencies are services.
Angular uses dependency injection to provide new components with the services they need.

In TypeScript, Angular can tell which services a component needs by looking at the types of its constructor parameters.
For example, the constructor of our `HeroListComponent` needs the `HeroService`:

When Angular creates a component, it first asks an **Injector** for
the services that the component requires.

An `Injector` maintains a container of service instances that it has previously created.
If a requested service instance is not in the container, the injector makes one and adds it to the container
before returning the service to Angular.
When all requested services have been resolved and returned,
Angular can call the component's constructor with those services as arguments.
This is what we mean by *dependency injection*.

The process of `HeroService` injection looks a bit like this:

If the `Injector` doesn't have a `HeroService`, how does it know how to make one?

In brief, we must have previously registered a **provider** of the `HeroService` with the `Injector`.
A provider is something that can create or return a service, typically  the service class itself.

We can register providers at any level of the application component tree.
We often do so at the root when we bootstrap the application so that
the same instance of a service is available everywhere.

Alternatively, we might register at a component level ...
... in which case we get a new instance of the
service with each new instance of that component.

We've vastly over-simplified dependency injection for this overview.
We can learn the full story in the Dependency Injection chapter.

The points to remember are:
* dependency injection is wired into the framework and used everywhere.<br><br>
* the `Injector` is the main mechanism.
  * an injector maintains a *container* of service instances that it created.
  * an injector can create a new service instance using a *provider*.
* a *provider* is a recipe for creating a service.

* we register *providers* with injectors.

We've learned just a bit about the eight main building blocks of an Angular application
That's a foundation for everything else in an Angular application
and it's more than enough to get going.
But it doesn't include everything we'll need or want to know.

## The Other Stuff

Here is a brief, alphabetical list of other important Angular features and services.
Most of them are covered in this Developers Guide (or soon will be):

>**Animations** - A forthcoming animation library makes it easy for developers to animate component behavior
without deep knowledge of animation techniques or css.

>**Bootstrap** - A method to configure and launch the root application component.

>**Change Detection** - Learn how Angular decides that a component property value has changed and
when to update the screen.
Learn how it uses **zones** to intercept asynchronous activity and run its change detection strategies.

>**With the Component Router service, users can navigate a multi-screen application
in a familiar web browsing style using URLs.

>**Events** - The DOM raises events. So can components and services. Angular offers mechanisms for
publishing and subscribing to events including an implementation of the RxJS Observable proposal.

>**Forms** - Support complex data entry scenarios with HTML-based validation and dirty checking.

>**HTTP** - Communicate with a server to get data, save data, and invoke server-side actions with this Angular HTTP client.

>**Lifecycle Hooks** - We can tap into key moments in the lifetime of a component, from its creation to its destruction,
by implementing the "Lifecycle Hook" interfaces.

>**Pipes** - Services that transform values for display.
We can put pipes in our templates to improve the user experience. For example,
this `currency` pipe expression,

>**Testing** - Angular provides a testing library for "unit testing" our application parts as they
interact with the Angular framework.



An **Attribute** directive changes the appearance or behavior of a DOM element.

In this chapter we will
* write an attribute directive to change the background color
* apply the attribute directive to an element in a template
* respond to user-initiated events
* pass values into the directive using data binding

## Directives overview

There are three kinds of directives in Angular:
1. Components
1. Structural directives
1. Attribute directives

The *Component* is really a directive with a template.
It's the most common of the three directives and we write lots of them as we build our application.

The *Structural* directive changes the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
NgForand NgIf are two familiar examples.

The *Attribute* directive changes the appearance or behavior of an element.
The built-in NgStyle directive, for example,
can change several element styles at the same time.

We are going to write our own attribute directive to set an element's background color
when the user hovers over that element.

We don't need *any* directive to simply set the background color.
We can set it with the special Style Binding like this:

That wouldn't be nearly as much fun as creating our own directive.

Besides, we're not just *setting* the color; we'll be *changing* the color
in response to a user action, a mouse hover.

## Build a simple attribute directive
An attribute directive minimally requires building a controller class annotated with a
`Directive` decorator. The `Directive` decorator specifies the selector identifying
the attribute associated with the directive.
The controller class implements the desired directive behavior.

Let's build a small illustrative example together.

### Our first draft
Create a new project folder (`attribute-directives`) and follow the steps in the QuickStart.

Add a new file to the `app` folder called `highlight.directive.ts` and add the following code:

We begin by importing some symbols from the Angular library.
We need the `Directive` symbol for the `@Directive` decorator.
We need the `ElementRef` to inject into the directive's constructor
so we can access the DOM element.
We don't need `Input` immediately but we will need it later in the chapter.

Then we define the directive metadata in a configuration object passed
as an argument to the `@Directive` decorator function.
A `@Directive` decorator for an attribute directive requires a css selector to identify
the HTML in the template that is associated with our directive.
The css selector for an attribute
is the attribute name in square brackets.

Our directive's selector is `[myHighlight]`.
Angular will locate all elements in the template that have an attribute named `myHighlight`.

### Why not call it "highlight"?
*highlight* is a nicer name than *myHighlight* and, technically, it would work if we called it that.

However, we recommend picking a selector name with a prefix to ensure
that it cannot conflict with any standard HTML attribute, now or in the future.
There is also less risk of colliding with a third-party directive name when we give ours a prefix.

We do **not** prefix our `highlight` directive name with **`ng`**.
That prefix belongs to Angular and
we don't want to confuse our directives with their directives.

We need a prefix of our own, preferably short, and `my` will do for now.

After the `@Directive` metadata comes the directive's controller class which we are exporting
to make it accessible to other components.
The directive's controller class contains the logic for the directive.

Angular creates a new instance of the directive's controller class for
each matching element, injecting an Angular `ElementRef`
into the constructor.

`ElementRef` is a service that grants us direct access to the DOM element
through its `nativeElement` property.
That's all we need to set the element's background color using the browser DOM API.

## Apply the attribute directive
The `AppComponent` in this sample is a test harness for our `HighlightDirective`.
Let's give it a new template that
applies the directive as an attribute to a `span` element.
In Angular terms, the `<span>` element will be the attribute **host**.

We'll put the template in its own `app.component.html` file that looks like this:
A separate template file is clearly overkill for a 2-line template.
Hang in there; we're going to expand it later.
Meanwhile, we'll revise the `AppComponent` to reference this template.

We've added an `import` statement to fetch the 'Highlight' directive and
added that class to a `directives` array in the component metadata so that Angular
will recognize our directive when it encounters `myHighlight` in the template.

We run the app and see that our directive highlights the span text.

#### Why isn't my directive working?

Did you remember to set the `directives` array? It is easy to forget!

Open the console in the browser tools and look for an error like this:
EXCEPTION: Template parse errors:
  Can't bind to 'myHighlight' since it isn't a known native property
Angular detects that we're trying to bind to *something* but it doesn't know what.
We have to tell it by listing `HighlightDirective` in the `directives` metadata array.
Let's recap what happened.

Angular found the `myHighlight` attribute on the `<span>` element. It created
an instance of the `HighlightDirective` class,
injecting a reference to the element into the constructor
where we set the `<span>` element's background style to yellow.

## Respond to user action

We are not satisfied to simply set an element color.
Our directive should set the color in response to a user action.
Specifically, we want to set the color when the user mouses over the element.

We'll need to
1. detect when the user mouses into and out of the element
1. respond to those actions by setting and clearing the highlight color.

Start with event detection.
We add a `host` property to the directive metadata and give it a configuration object
that specifies two mouse events and the directive methods to call when they are raised.

The `host` property refers to the DOM element that hosts our attribute directive, the `<span>` in our case.

We could have attached an event listener to the native element (`el.nativeElement`) with
plain old JavaScript.
There are at least three problems with that approach:

1. We have to write the listeners correctly.
1. We must *detach* our listener when the directive is destroyed to avoid memory leaks.
1. We'd be talking to DOM API directly which, we learned, is something to avoid.

Let's roll with the `host` property.

Now we implement those two mouse event handlers:

Notice that they delegate to a helper method to set the color.

We no longer need the constructor body but
we still want the injected `ElementRef`.
We revise the constructor signature to capture the injected `ElementRef` in a private variable
and clear the body.

Here's the updated directive:
We run the app and confirm that the background color appears as we move the mouse over the `span` and
disappears as we move out.

## Configure the directive with binding

Currently the highlight color is hard-coded within the directive. That's inflexible.
We should set the highlight color externally with a binding like this:

We'll extend our directive class with a bindable **input** `highlightColor` property and use it when we highlight text.

Here is the final version of the class:

The new `highlightColor` property is called an "input" property because data flows from the binding expression into our directive.
Notice that we call the `@Input()` decorator function while defining the property.

This `@Input` decorator adds metadata to the class that makes the `highlightColor` property  available for property binding
under the `myHighlight` alias.
We must add this input metadata or Angular will reject the binding.
See the appendix below to learn why.

The developer who uses our directive expects to bind to the attribute name, `myHighlight`.
The directive property name is `highlightColor`. That's a disconnect.

We can resolve the discrepancy by renaming the property to `myHighlight` and define it as follows:

Maybe we don't want that property name inside the directive perhaps because it
doesn't express our intention well.
We can **alias** the `highlightColor` property with the attribute name by
passing `myHighlight` into the `@Input` decorator:

Now that we're getting the highlight color as an input, we modify the `onMouseEnter()` method to use
it instead of the hard-coded color name.
We also define a red default color as a fallback in case
the user neglects to bind with a color.

Now we'll update our `AppComponent` template to let
users pick the highlight color and bind their choice to our directive.

Here is the updated template:

### Where is the templated *color* property?

The eagle-eyed may notice that the radio button click handlers in the template set a `color` property
and we are binding that `color` to the directive.
We should expect to find a `color` on the host `AppComponent`.

**We never defined a color property for the host *AppComponent***!
And yet this code works. Where is the template `color` value going?

Browser debugging reveals that Angular dynamically added a `color` property
to the runtime instance of the `AppComponent`.

This is *convenient* behavior but it is also *implicit* behavior that could be confusing.
While it's cool that this technique works, we recommend adding the `color` property to the `AppComponent`.

Here is our second version of the directive in action.

## Bind to a second property
Our directive only has a single, customizable property. What if we had ***two properties***?

Let's let the template developer set the default color, the color that prevails until the user picks a highlight color.
We'll add a second **input** property to `HighlightDirective` called `defaultColor`:

The `defaultColor` property has a setter that overrides the hard-coded default color, "red".
We don't need a getter.

How do we bind to it? We already "burned" the `myHighlight` attribute name as a binding target.

Remember that a *component is a directive too*.
We can add as many component property bindings as we need by stringing them along in the template
as in this example that sets the `a`, `b`, `c` properties to the string literals 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
We do the same thing with an attribute directive.
Here we're binding the user's color choice to the `myHighlight` attribute as we did before.
We're *also* binding the literal string, 'violet', to the `defaultColor`.

Here is the final version of the directive in action.

Now we know how to
- build a simple **attribute directive** to attach behavior to an HTML element,
- use that directive in a template,
- respond to **events** to change behavior based on an event,
- and use **binding** to pass values to the attribute directive.

The final source:

### Appendix: Input properties

Earlier we declared the `highlightColor` property to be an ***input*** property of our
`HighlightDirective`

We've seen properties in bindings before.
We never had to declare them as anything. Why now?

Angular makes a subtle but important distinction between binding **sources** and **targets**.

In all previous bindings, the directive or component property was a binding ***source***.
A property is a *source* if it appears in the template expression to the ***right*** of the equals (=).

A property is a *target* when it appears in **square brackets** ([ ]) to the **left** of the equals (=) ...
as it is does when we bind to the `myHighlight` property of the `HighlightDirective`,

The 'color' in `[myHighlight]="color"` is a binding ***source***.
A source property doesn't require a declaration.

The 'myHighlight' in `[myHighlight]="color"` *is* a binding ***target***.
We must declare it as an *input* property.
Angular rejects the binding with a clear error if we don't.

Angular treats a *target* property differently for a good reason.
A component or directive in target position needs protection.

Imagine that our `HighlightDirective` did truly wonderous things.
We graciously made a gift of it to the world.

To our surprise, some people &mdash; perhaps naively &mdash;
started binding to *every* property of our directive.
Not just the one or two properties we expected them to target. *Every* property.
That could really mess up our directive in ways we didn't anticipate and have no desire to support.

The *input* declaration ensures that consumers of our directive can only bind to
the properties of our public API ... nothing else.

**Dependency injection** is an important application design pattern.
Angular has its own dependency injection framework, and
we really can't build an Angular application without it.
It's used so widely that almost everyone just calls it _DI_.

In this chapter we'll learn what DI is and why we want it.
Then we'll learn how to use it in an Angular app.

## Why dependency injection?

Let's start with the following code.

Our `Car` creates everything it needs inside its constructor.
What's the problem?

The problem is that our `Car` class is brittle, inflexible, and hard to test.

Our `Car` needs an engine and tires. Instead of asking for them,
the `Car` constructor creates its own copies by "new-ing" them from
the very specific classes, `Engine` and `Tires`.

What if the `Engine` class evolves and its constructor requires a parameter?
Our `Car` is broken and stays broken until we rewrite it along the lines of
`this.engine = new Engine(theNewParameter)`.
We didn't care about `Engine` constructor parameters when we first wrote `Car`.
We don't really care about them now.
But we'll *have* to start caring because
when the definion of `Engine` changes, our `Car` class must change.
That makes `Car` brittle.

What if we want to put a different brand of tires on our `Car`? Too bad.
We're locked into whatever brand the `Tires` class creates. That makes our `Car` inflexible.

Right now each new car gets its own engine. It can't share an engine with other cars.
While that makes sense for an automobile engine,
we can think of other dependencies that should be shared, such as the onboard
wireless connection to the manufacturer's service center. Our `Car` lacks the flexibility
to share services that have been created previously for other consumers.

When we write tests for our `Car` we're at the mercy of its hidden dependencies.
Is it even possible to create a new `Engine` in a test environment?
What does `Engine`itself depend upon? What does that dependency depend on?
Will a new instance of `Engine` make an asynchronous call to the server?
We certainly don't want that going on during our tests.

What if our `Car` should flash a warning signal when tire pressure is low?
How do we confirm that it actually does flash a warning
if we can't swap in low-pressure tires during the test?

We have no control over the car's hidden dependencies.
When we can't control the dependencies, a class become difficult to test.

How can we make `Car` more robust, flexible, and testable?

That's super easy. We probably already know what to do. We change our `Car` constructor to a version with DI:

See what happened? We moved the definition of the dependencies to the constructor.
Our `Car` class no longer creates an engine or tires.
It just consumes them.

We also leverage TypeScript's constructor syntax for declaring parameters and properties simultaneously.
Now we create a car by passing the engine and tires to the constructor.

How cool is that?
The definition of the engine and tire dependencies are decoupled from the `Car` class itself.
We can pass in any kind of engine or tires we like, as long as they
conform to the general API requirements of an engine or tires.

If someone extends the `Engine` class, that is not `Car`'s problem.

The _consumer_ of `Car` has the problem. The consumer must update the car creation code to
something like this:

The critical point is this: `Car` itself did not have to change.
We'll take care of the consumer's problem soon enough.

The `Car` class is much easier to test because we are in complete control
of its dependencies.
We can pass mocks to the constructor that do exactly what we want them to do
during each test:

**We just learned what dependency injection is**.

It's a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external
sources rather than creating them itself.

Cool! But what about that poor consumer?
Anyone who wants a `Car` must now
create all three parts: the `Car`, `Engine`, and `Tires`.
The `Car` class shed its problems at the consumer's expense.
We need something that takes care of assembling these parts for us.

We could write a giant class to do that:

It's not so bad now with only three creation methods.
But maintaining it will be hairy as the application grows.
This factory is going to become a huge spiderweb of
interdependent factory methods!

Wouldn't it be nice if we could simply list the things we want to build without
having to define which dependency gets injected into what?

This is where the dependency injection framework comes into play.
Imagine the framework had something called an _injector_.
We register some classes with this injector, and it figures out how to create them.

When we need a `Car`, we simply ask the injector to get it for us and we're good to go.

Everyone wins. The `Car` knows nothing about creating an `Engine` or `Tires`.
The consumer knows nothing about creating a `Car`.
We don't have a gigantic factory class to maintain.
Both `Car` and consumer simply ask for what they need and the injector delivers.

This is what a **dependency injection framework** is all about.

Now that we know what dependency injection is and appreciate its benefits,
let's see how it is implemented in Angular.

## Angular dependency injection

Angular ships with its own dependency injection framework. This framework can also be used
as a standalone module by other applications and frameworks.

That sounds nice. What does it do for us when building components in Angular?
Let's see, one step at a time.

We'll begin with a simplified version of the `HeroesComponent`
that we built in the The Tour of Heroes.

The `HeroesComponent` is the root component of the *Heroes* feature area.
It governs all the child components of this area.
Our stripped down version has only one child, `HeroListComponent`,
which displays a list of heroes.

Do we really need so many files? Of course not!
We're going *beyond* the strictly necessary
in order to illustrate patterns that work well in real applications.

Right now `HeroListComponent` gets heroes from `HEROES`, an in-memory collection
defined in another file and imported by this component.
That may suffice in the early stages of development, but it's far from ideal.
As soon as we try to test this component or want to get our heroes data from a remote server,
we'll have to change the implementation of `heroes` and
fix every other use of the `HEROES` mock data.

Let's make a service that hides how we get hero data.

Write this service in its own file. See this note to understand why.

Our `HeroService` exposes a `getHeroes` method that returns
the same mock data as before, but none of its consumers need to know that.

We aren't even pretending this is a real service.
If we were actually getting data from a remote server, the API would have to be asynchronous,
perhaps returning
ES2015 promises.
We'd also have to rewrite the way components consume our service.
This is important in general, but not to our current story.

A service is nothing more than a class in Angular 2.
It remains nothing more than a class until we register it with an Angular injector.

### Configuring the injector

We don't have to create an Angular injector.
Angular creates an application-wide injector for us during the bootstrap process.

We do have to configure the injector by registering the **providers**
that create the services our application requires.
We'll explain what providers are later in this chapter.
Before we do, let's see an example of provider registration during bootstrapping:

The injector now knows about our `HeroService`.
An instance of our `HeroService` will be available for injection across our entire application.

Of course we can't help wondering about that comment telling us not to do it this way.
It *will* work. It's just not a best practice.
The bootstrap provider option is intended for configuring and overriding Angular's own
preregistered services, such as its routing support.

The preferred approach is to register application providers in application components.
Because the `HeroService` is used within the *Heroes* feature area &mdash;
and nowhere else &mdash; the ideal place to register it is in the top-level `HeroesComponent`.

### Registering providers in a component
Here's a revised `HeroesComponent` that registers the `HeroService`.

Look closely at the `providers` part of the `@Component` metadata:

An instance of the `HeroService` is now available for injection in this `HeroesComponent`
and all of its child components.

The `HeroesComponent` itself doesn't happen to need the `HeroService`.
But its child `HeroListComponent` does, so we head there next.

The `HeroListComponent` should get heroes from the injected `HeroService`.
Per the dependency injection pattern, the component must ask for the service in its constructor, as we explained
earlier.
It's a small change:

### Focus on the constructor

  Adding a parameter to the constructor isn't all that's happening here.

We're writing in TypeScript and have followed the parameter name with a type annotation, `:HeroService`.
The class is also decorated with the `@Component` decorator (scroll up to confirm that fact).

When the TypeScript compiler evaluates this class, it sees the `@Component` decorator and adds class metadata
into the generated JavaScript code. Within that metadata lurks the information that
associates the `heroService` parameter with the `HeroService` class.

That's how the Angular injector knows to inject an instance of the `HeroService` when it
creates a new `HeroListComponent`.

### Creating the injector (implicitly)
When we introduced the idea of an injector above, we showed how to create
an injector and use it to create a new `Car`.

We won't find code like that in the Tour of Heroes or any of our other samples.
We *could* write code with an explicit injector if we *had* to, but we rarely do.
Angular takes care of creating and calling injectors
when it creates components for us &mdash; whether through HTML markup, as in `<hero-list></hero-list>`,
or after navigating to a component with the router.
If we let Angular do its job, we'll enjoy the benefits of automated dependency injection.

Dependencies are singletons within the scope of an injector.
In our example, a single `HeroService` instance is shared among the
`HeroesComponent` and its `HeroListComponent` children.

However, Angular DI is an hierarchical injection
system, which means that nested injectors can create their own service instances.
Learn more about that in the Hierarchical Injectors chapter.

### Testing the component
We emphasized earlier that designing a class for dependency injection makes the class easier to test.
Listing dependencies as constructor parameters may be all we need to test application parts effectively.

For example, we can create a new `HeroListComponent` with a mock service that we can manipulate
under test:

Learn more in Testing.

### When the service needs a service
Our `HeroService` is very simple. It doesn't have any dependencies of its own.


What if it had a dependency? What if it reported its activities through a logging service?
We'd apply the same *constructor injection* pattern,
adding a constructor that takes a `Logger` parameter.

Here is the revision compared to the original.

The constructor now asks for an injected instance of a `Logger` and stores it in a private property called `_logger`.
We call that property within our `getHeroes` method when anyone asks for heroes.

Notice the `@Injectable()` decoration above the service class.
We haven't seen `@Injectable()` before.
As it happens, we could have added it to our first version of `HeroService`.
We didn't bother because we didn't need it then.

We need it now... now that our service has an injected dependency.
We need it because Angular requires constructor parameter metadata in order to inject a `Logger`.
As we mentioned earlier, **TypeScript only generates metadata for classes that have a decorator.**

Always add @Injectable()
We recommend adding `@Injectable()` to every service class, even those that don't have dependencies
and, therefore, do not technically require it. Here's why:

The `HeroesComponent` has an injected dependency too. Why don't we add `@Injectable()` to the `HeroesComponent`?

We *can* add it if we really want to. It isn't necessary because the `HeroesComponent` is already decorated with `@Component`.
TypeScript generates metadata for *any* class with a decorator, and *any* decorator will do.

**Always include the parentheses!** Always call `@Injectable()`.
Our application will fail mysteriously if we forget the parentheses.

## Creating and registering a logger service
We're injecting a logger into our `HeroService` in two steps:
1. Create the logger service.
1. Register it with the application.

The logger service implementation is no big deal.

We're likely to need the same logger service everywhere in our application,
so we put it at the root level of the application in the `app/` folder, and
we register it in the `providers` array of the metadata for our application root component, `AppComponent`.
If we forget to register the logger, Angular throws an exception when it first looks for the logger:
EXCEPTION: No provider for Logger! (HeroListComponent -> HeroService -> Logger)

That's Angular telling us that the dependency injector couldn't find the *provider* for the logger.
It needed that provider to create a `Logger` to inject into a new
`HeroService`, which it needed to
create and inject into a new `HeroListComponent`.

The chain of creations started with the `Logger` provider. The *provider* is the subject of our next section.

But wait!  What if the logger is optional?

### Optional dependencies

Our `HeroService` currently requires a `Logger`. What if we could get by without a logger?
We'd use it if we had it, ignore it if we didn't. We can do that.

First import the `@Optional()` decorator.

Then rewrite the constructor with `@Optional()` decorator preceding the private `_logger` parameter.
That tells the injector that `_logger` is optional.

Be prepared for a null logger. If we don't register one somewhere up the line,
the injector will inject `null`. We have a method that logs.
What can we do to avoid a null reference exception?

We could substitute a *do-nothing* logger stub so that calling methods continue to work:

Obviously we'd take a more sophisticated approach if the logger were optional
in multiple locations.

But enough about optional loggers. In our sample application, the `Logger` is required.
We must register a `Logger` with the application injector using *providers*,
as we learn in the next section.

## Injector providers

A provider *provides* the concrete, runtime version of a dependency value.
The injector relies on **providers** to create instances of the services
that the injector injects into components and other services.

We must register a service *provider* with the injector, or it won't know how to create the service.

Earlier we registered the `Logger` service in the `providers` array of the metadata for the `AppComponent` like this:

The `providers` array appears to hold a service class.
In reality it holds an instance of the Provider class that can create that service.

There are many ways to *provide* something that looks and behaves like a `Logger`.
The `Logger` class itself is an obvious and natural provider &mdash; it has the right shape and it's designed to be created.
But it's not the only way.

We can configure the injector with alternative providers that can deliver an object that behaves like a `Logger`.
We could provide a substitute class. We could provide a logger-like object.
We could give it a provider that calls a logger factory function.
Any of these approaches might be a good choice under the right circumstances.

What matters is that the injector has a provider to go to when it needs a `Logger`.

### The *provide* function

We wrote the `providers` array like this:

This is actually a short-hand expression for a provider registration that creates a new instance of the

In both approaches &mdash; `Provider` class and `provide` function &mdash;
we supply two arguments.

The first is the token that serves as the key for both locating a dependency value
and registering the provider.

The second is a provider definition object,
which we can think of as a *recipe* for creating the dependency value.
There are many ways to create dependency values... and many ways to write a recipe.

### Alternative class providers

Occasionally we'll ask a different class to provide the service.
The following code tells the injector
to return a `BetterLogger` when something asks for the `Logger`.

### Class provider with dependencies
Maybe an `EvenBetterLogger` could display the user name in the log message.
This logger gets the user from the injected `UserService`,
which happens also to be injected at the application level.

Configure it like we did `BetterLogger`.

### Aliased class providers

Suppose an old component depends upon an `OldLogger` class.
`OldLogger` has the same interface as the `NewLogger`, but for some reason
we can't update the old component to use it.

When the *old* component logs a message with `OldLogger`,
we want the singleton instance of `NewLogger` to handle it instead.

The dependency injector should inject that singleton instance
when a component asks for either the new or the the old logger.
The `OldLogger` should be an alias for `NewLogger`.

We certainly do not want two different `NewLogger` instances in our app.
Unfortunately, that's what we get if we try to alias `OldLogger` to `NewLogger` with `useClass`.

The solution: Alias with the `useExisting` option.

### Value providers

Sometimes it's easier to provide a ready-made object rather than ask the injector to create it from a class.

Then we register a provider with the `useValue` option,
which makes this object play the logger role.

### Factory providers

Sometimes we need to create the dependent value dynamically,
based on information we won't have until the last possible moment.
Maybe the information changes repeatedly in the course of the browser session.

Suppose also that the injectable service has no independent access to the source of this information.

This situation calls for a **factory provider**.

Let's illustrate by adding a new business requirement:
The HeroService must hide *secret* heroes from normal users.
Only authorized users should see secret heroes.

Like the `EvenBetterLogger`, the `HeroService` needs a fact about the user.
It needs to know if the user is authorized to see secret heroes.
That authorization can change during the course of a single application session,
as when we log in a different user.

Unlike `EvenBetterLogger`, we can't inject the `UserService` into the `HeroService`.
The `HeroService` won't have direct access to the user information to decide
who is authorized and who is not.

Why? We don't know either. Stuff like this happens.
Instead the `HeroService` constructor takes a boolean flag to control display of secret heroes.

We can inject the `Logger`, but we can't inject the  boolean `isAuthorized`.
We'll have to take over the creation of new instances of this `HeroService` with a factory provider.

A factory provider needs a factory function:

Although the `HeroService` has no access to the `UserService`, our factory function does.

We inject both the `Logger` and the `UserService` into the factory provider and let the injector pass them along to the factory function:

  The `useFactory` field tells Angular that the provider is a factory function
  whose implementation is the `heroServiceFactory`.

  The `deps` property is an array of provider tokens.
  The `Logger` and `UserService` classes serve as tokens for their own class providers.
  The injector resolves these tokens and injects the corresponding services into the matching factory function parameters.

Notice that we captured the factory provider in an exported variable, `heroServiceProvider`.
This extra step makes the factory provider reusable.
We can register our `HeroService` with this variable wherever we need it.

In our sample, we need it only in the `HeroesComponent`,
where it replaces the previous `HeroService` registration in the metadata `providers` array.
Here we see the new and the old implementation side-by-side:

## Dependency injection tokens

When we register a provider with an injector, we associate that provider with a dependency injection token.
The injector maintains an internal *token-provider* map that it references when
asked for a dependency. The token is the key to the map.

In all previous examples, the dependency value has been a class *instance*, and
the class *type* served as its own lookup key.
Here we get a `HeroService` directly from the injector by supplying the `HeroService` type as the token:

We have similar good fortune when we write a constructor that requires an injected class-based dependency.
We define a constructor parameter with the `HeroService` class type,
and Angular knows to inject the
service associated with that `HeroService` class token:

This is especially convenient when we consider that most dependency values are provided by classes.

### Non-class dependencies

What if the dependency value isn't a class?
Sometimes the thing we want to inject is a string, a function, or an object.

Applications often define configuration objects with lots of small facts like the title of the application or the address of a web API endpoint.
These configuration objects aren't always instances of a class. They tend to be object hashes like this one:

We'd like to make this `config` object available for injection.
We know we can register an object with a value provider.
But what do we use for the token?
We don't have a class to serve as a token. There is no `Config` class.

### Interfaces aren't valid tokens

The `CONFIG` constant has an interface, `Config`. Unfortunately, we
cannot use an interface as a token:

That seems strange if we're used to dependency injection in strongly typed languages, where
an interface is the preferred dependency lookup key.

It's not Angular's fault. An interface is a TypeScript design-time artifact. JavaScript doesn't have interfaces.
The TypeScript interface disappears from the generated JavaScript.
There is no interface type information left for Angular to find at runtime.

### String tokens
Fortunately, we can register any dependency provider with a string token.

Now we inject the configuration object into any constructor that needs it, with
the help of an `@Inject` decorator that tells Angular how to find the configuration dependency value.
Although it plays no role in dependency injection,
the `Config` interface supports strong typing of the configuration object within the class.

### OpaqueToken
Alternatively, we could define and use an OpaqueToken
rather than rely on magic strings that may collide with other developers' string choices.

The definition looks like this:

Substitute `APP_CONFIG` for the magic string when registering the provider and defining the constructor parameter:

Here's how we provide and inject the configuration object in our top-level `AppComponent`.

Angular itself uses `OpaqueToken` objects to register all of its own non-class dependencies. For example,
HTTP_PROVIDERS
is the `OpaqueToken` associated with an array of providers for persisting data with the Angular `Http` client.

Internally, the `Provider` turns both the string and the class type into an `OpaqueToken`
and keys its *token-provider* map with that.


We learned the basics of Angular dependency injection in this chapter.
We can register various kinds of providers,
and we know how to ask for an injected object (such as a service) by
adding a parameter to a constructor.

Angular dependency injection is more capable than we've described.
We can learn more about its advanced features, beginning with its support for
nested injectors, in the

### Appendix: Working with injectors directly
We rarely work directly with an injector.
Here's an `InjectorComponent` that does.

The `Injector` is itself an injectable service.

In this example, Angular injects the component's own `Injector` into the component's constructor.
The component then asks the injected injector for the services it wants.

Note that the services themselves are not injected into the component.
They are retrieved by calling `injector.get`.

The `get` method throws an error if it can't resolve the requested service.
We can call `getOptional` instead, which we do in one case
to retrieve a service (`ROUS`) that isn't registered with this or any ancestor injector.

The technique we just described is an example of the
service locator pattern.

We **avoid** this technique unless we genuinely need it.
It encourages a careless grab-bag approach such as we see here.
It's difficult to explain, understand, and test.
We can't know by inspecting the constructor what this class requires or what it will do.
It could acquire services from any ancestor component, not just its own.
We're forced to spelunk the implementation to discover what it does.

Framework developers may take this approach when they
must acquire services generically and dynamically.

### Appendix: Why we recommend one class per file

Having multiple classes in the same file is confusing and best avoided.
Developers expect one class per file. Keep them happy.

If we scorn this advice and, say,
combine our `HeroService` class with the `HeroesComponent` in the same file,
**define the component last!**
If we define the component before the service,
we'll get a runtime null reference error.

We actually can define the component first with the help of the `forwardRef()` method as explained
in this blog post.
But why flirt with trouble?
Avoid the problem altogether by defining components and services in separate files.

We typically display data in Angular by binding controls in an HTML template
to properties of an Angular component.

In this chapter, we'll create a component with a list of heroes. Each hero has a name.
We'll display the list of hero names and
conditionally show a selected hero in a detail area below the list.

The final UI looks like this:


## Showing component properties with interpolation
The easiest way to display a component property
is to bind the property name through interpolation.
With interpolation, we put the property name in the view template, enclosed in double curly braces: `{{myHero}}`.

Let's build a small illustrative example together.

Create a new project folder (`displaying-data`) and follow the steps in the QuickStart.

Then modify the `app.component.ts` file by changing the template and the body of the component.
When we're done, it should look like this:

We added two properties to the formerly empty component: `title` and `myHero`.

Our revised template displays the two component properties using double curly brace
interpolation:

The template is a multi-line string within ECMAScript 2015 backticks (\`).
The backtick (\`) &mdash; which is *not* the same character as a single
quote (') &mdash; has many nice features. The feature we're exploiting here
is the ability to compose the string over several lines, which makes for
much more readable HTML.

Angular automatically pulls the value of the `title` and `myHero` properties from the component and
inserts those values into the browser. Angular updates the display
when these properties change.

More precisely, the redisplay occurs after some kind of asynchronous event related to
the view such as a keystroke, a timer completion, or an async `XHR` response.
We don't have those in this sample.
But then the properties aren't changing on their own either. For the moment we must operate on faith.

Notice that we haven't called **new** to create an instance of the `AppComponent` class.
Angular is creating an instance for us. How?

Notice the CSS `selector` in the `@Component` decorator that specifies an element named "my-app".
Remember back in QuickStart that we added the `<my-app>` element to the body of our `index.html`

When we bootstrap with the `AppComponent` class (see `main.ts`), Angular looks for a `<my-app>`
in the `index.html`, finds it, instantiates an instance of `AppComponent`, and renders it
inside the `<my-app>` tag.

We're ready to see changes in a running app by firing up the npm script that both compiles and serves our applications
while watching for changes.

We should see the title and hero name:

Let's review some of the choices we made and consider alternatives.

## Template inline or template file?

We can store our component's template in one of two places.
We can define it *inline* using the `template` property, as we do here.
Or we can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in
the component metadata using the `@Component` decorator's `templateUrl` property.

The choice between inline and separate HTML is a matter of taste,
circumstances, and organization policy.
Here we're using inline HTML because the template is small, and the demo
is simpler without the HTML file.

In either style, the template data bindings have the same access to the component's properties.

## Constructor or variable initialization?

We initialized our component properties using variable assignment.
This is a wonderfully concise and compact technique.

Some folks prefer to declare the properties and initialize them within a constructor like this:

That's fine too. The choice is a matter of taste and organization policy.
We'll adopt the more terse "variable assignment" style in this chapter simply because
there will be less code to read.


## Showing an array property with NgFor

We want to display a list of heroes. We begin by adding a mock heroes name array to the component,
just above `myHero`, and redefine `myHero` to be the first name in the array.

Now we use the Angular `NgFor` "repeater" directive in the template to display
each item in the `heroes` list.

Our presentation is the familiar HTML unordered list with `<ul>` and `<li>` tags. Let's focus on the `<li>` tag.

We added a somewhat mysterious `*ngFor` to the `<li>` element.
That's the Angular "repeater" directive.
Its presence on the `<li>` tag marks that `<li>` element (and its children) as the "repeater template".

Don't forget the leading asterisk (\*) in `*ngFor`. It is an essential part of the syntax.
Learn more about this and `NgFor` in the Template Syntax chapter.


Notice the `#hero` in the `NgFor` double-quoted instruction.
The `#hero` is a local template variable declaration.
The `#` prefix declares a local variable name named `hero`.

Angular duplicates the `<li>` for each item in the list, setting the `hero` variable
to the item (the hero) in the current iteration. Angular uses that variable as the
context for the interpolation in the double curly braces.


We happened to give `NgFor` an array to display.
In fact, `NgFor` can repeat items for any iterable
object.

Assuming we're still running under the `npm start` command,
we should see heroes appearing in an unordered list.

## Creating a class for the data

We are defining our data directly inside our component.
That's fine for a demo but certainly isn't a best practice. It's not even a good practice.
Although we won't do anything about that in this chapter, we'll make a mental note to fix this down the road.

At the moment, we're binding to an array of strings. We do that occasionally in real applications, but
most of the time we're displaying objects &mdash; potentially instances of classes.

Let's turn our array of hero names into an array of `Hero` objects. For that we'll need a `Hero` class.

Create a new file in the `app/` folder called `hero.ts` with the following short bit of code.

We've defined a class with a constructor and two properties: `id` and `name`.

It might not look like we have properties, but we do. We're taking
advantage of a TypeScript shortcut in our declaration of the constructor parameters.

Consider the first parameter:

That brief syntax does a lot:
* declares a constructor parameter and its type
* declares a public property of the same name
* initializes that property with the corresponding argument when we "new" an instance of the class

Let's redefine the `heroes` property in our component to return an array of these Hero objects
and also set the `myHero` property with the first of these mock heroes.

We'll have to update the template.
At the moment it displays the entire `hero` object, which used to be a string value.
Let's fix that so we interpolate the `hero.name` property.

Our display looks the same, but now we know much better what a hero really is.

## Conditional display with NgIf

Sometimes the app should display a view or a portion of a view only under specific circumstances.

In our example, we'd like to display a message if we have a large number of heroes &mdash; say, more than 3.

The Angular `NgIf` directive inserts or removes an element based on a truthy/falsey condition.
We can see it in action by adding the following paragraph at the bottom of the template:

Don't forget the leading asterisk (\*) in `*ngIf`. It is an essential part of the syntax.
Learn more about this and `NgIf` in the Template Syntax chapter.

The template expression inside the double quotes
looks much like JavaScript and it _is_ much like JavaScript.
When the component's list of heroes has more than 3 items, Angular adds the paragraph to the DOM and the message appears.

Angular isn't showing and hiding the message. It is adding and removing the paragraph element from the DOM.
That hardly matters here. It would matter a great deal from a performance perspective if
we were conditionally including or excluding a big chunk of HTML with many data bindings.

Try it out. Because the array has four items, the message should appear.
Go back into `app.component.ts` and delete or comment out one of the elements from the hero array.
The browser should refresh automatically and the message should disappear.

Now we know how to use:
- **interpolation** with double curly braces to display a component property
- **`NgFor`** to display a list of items
- a TypeScript class to shape the **model data** for our component and display properties of that model
- **`NgIf`** to conditionally display a chunk of HTML based on a boolean expression

Here's our final code:


Farewell to this land's cheerless marches
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing

I say Charles don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?

And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other

Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were

So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing - you should hear me play piano"

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No-one talks about castration

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
These are the things that kill me

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
These are the things that kill me

Passed the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Life is very long, when you're lonely

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way and it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history

Frankly, Mr Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the 21st century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history Mr Shankly

Fame, fame, fatal fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I rather be famous
Than righteous or holy, any day, any day, any day

But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way and it corrodes my soul
Oh, I didn't realise that you wrote poetry
I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry Mr Shankly

Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
But still, I must speak frankly, Mr Shankly, give us money

Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling
I don't know where else I can go, mother

Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?

Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Although she needs you more than she loves you

And I know it's over
Still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
It's over, it's over, it's over

I know it's over
And it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me and said:

"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know because tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they are in each other's arms"

It's so easy to laugh
It's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's over, over, over

It's so easy to laugh
It's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
It's over, over, over

Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I, my love

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head

When you walk without ease
On these streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days

And I know that, I know that
I never had no one ever

Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude

I know I'm alone
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone

And I never, never had no one ever
I never had no one ever


A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side

A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people all those lives
Where are they now?
With the loves and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived and then they died
Seems so unfair
And I want to cry

You say: "ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well, and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take "on loans"
There's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall

You say: "ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then you then produce the text
From whence was ripped some dizzy whore, 1804

A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side

A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
But you lose because Wilde is on mine

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said I'd like to
Smash every tooth in your head

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said by rights you should be
Bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt

Bigmouth, bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know of Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt

Bigmouth, bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race


The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire for love

How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me
How can they hear me say those words
And still they don't believe me
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?

The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire for love

How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live
How do you start?
Where do you go?
Who do you know?


I was minding mind business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
Just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
Of a vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

A scanty bit of a thing
With a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a child
As Rose collects the money in the canister
Who comes sliding down the banister
The vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

The monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again
My God
Vicar in a tutu, oh yeah

The next day in the pulpit
With freedom and ease
Combating ignorance, dust and disease
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain he dances again
And again and again
The fabric of a tutu
Any man could get used to
And I am a living sign


Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
Who are young and alive
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore

Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car
Oh please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus
Crashes in to us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
But then a strange fear gripped me
And I just couldn't ask

Take me out tonight
Oh take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
No, I haven't got one

And if a double-decker bus
Crashes in to us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out

Some girls mothers are bigger than other girls mothers

As Antony said to Cleopatra
As he opened a crate of ale

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls mothers are bigger than other girls mothers

Trudging slowly over wet sand
Back to the bench

Etch a postcard,
"How I dearly wish I was not here."

In the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come—nuclear bomb!

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face, on your face, on your face, on your face

Everyday is like Sunday

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are


Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye


Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME


Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

urther into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche
The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
you made him old

Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now

Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
oh people said
that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong!

Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
oh people said
that you were easily led
and they were half-right

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
you made him old

Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now

Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
oh people see no worth in you
oh but I do

Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
oh people see no worth in you
but I do

I dreamt about you last night
and I fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me
like a butterfly

But take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I

Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly

Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

As merry as the days were long
I am right and you were long
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose

But you've got everything now
you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
so who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...

You are your Mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
but I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen
in the back of your car

A friendship sadly lost?
well, this is true
and yet, it's false
but did I ever tell you, by the way
I never did like your face

But you've got everything now
you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
so who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...

You are your Mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
but I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
to the back of your car

So, goodbye
Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine

There's something against us
It's not time
It's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And "love" is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once - twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once - twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
It means: I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
...Whalley Range!
Into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...

I need advice, I need advice
I need advice, I need advice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
Nobody ever looks at me twice

I'm just a country-mile behind
The world

I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...

I'm just a country-mile behind
The world

I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...

Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...

Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...

I need advice, I need advice

Upon the sand, upon the bay
"There is a quick and easy way" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am"

And Sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone

And Pretty Girls Make Graves
Oh...

End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say: "Give in to lust,
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
Soon be dust... "

Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

And Sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone

And Pretty Girls Make Graves
Oh really?
Oh...

I could have been wild and I could have
Been free
But Nature played this trick on me

She wants it Now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate

Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)

I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith...
Oh...

Hand in glove...
The sun shines out of our behinds...
Oh...


Please don't cry
For the ghost and the storm outside
Will not invade this sacred shrine
Nor infiltrate your mind
My life down I shall lie
If the bogey-man should try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
To tease, torment, and tantalise
Wavering shadows loom
A piano plays in an empty room
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
And when darknesss lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
For you are all that matters
And I'll love you to till the day I die
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Ceiling shadows shimmy by
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
My life down I shall lie
Should restless spirits try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
I once had a child, and it saved my life
And I never even asked his name
I just looked into his wondrous eyes
And said: "never never never again"
And all too soon I did return
Just like a moth to a flame
So rattle my bones all over the stones
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
Oh, see how words as old as sin
Fit me like a glove
I'm here and here I'll stay
Together we lie, together we pray
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Mine
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy
Although you're only three, sonny boy
You're - you're mine
And your mother she just never knew
Oh, your mother...
As long... as long... as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
As long... as long... as long as... as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
Oh...

I decree today that life is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why and I'll spit in your eye

But we cannot cling
to the old dreams anymore
no we cannot cling
to those dreams

Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like
the old days anymore
no it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
am I still ill?

Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

Ask me why and I'll die
oh ask me why and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often

Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like
the old days anymore
no it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
am I still ill?


Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds

No it's NOT like any other love
this one's different
because it's us!

Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me

And if the people stare
then, the people stare
oh I really don't know
and I really don't care

Hand in glove
the Good People laugh

Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
but we have something they'll never have

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds

Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
but we have something they'll never have

And if the people stare
then, the people stare
oh I really don't know
and I really don't care

So hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath

If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath

The good life is out there somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer

But I know my luck too well
yes, I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again

All men have secrets and here is mine so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide
I can surely rely on you
and yet you start to recoil
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but I'd still leap in front of a flying bullet for you

So what difference does it make?
so what difference does it make?
it makes none, but now you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight

The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why? because you asked me to
but now you make me feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you

So what difference does it make?
so what difference does it make?
it makes none, but now you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

Oh the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and then I lied just because you asked me to
but now you know the truth about me
you won't see me anymore
well, I'm still fond of you

But no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired, I'm so very tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
but I'm still fond of you


Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"?
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"

Oh, but you will
For you must

I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

You should not go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"?
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"

But you will
For you must

I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

Too freely on your lips
Words prematurely sad
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight

Life is never kind
Life is never kind
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight


Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down

Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down

Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
Oh John, you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for

Edward, see those alluring lights?
Tonight will be your very last night

A woman said: "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"

Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says:
"Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone"

But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death

Hindley wakes and says:
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says:
"Oh, whatever he has done, I have done"

But this is no easy ride
For a child cries:

"Oh, find me... find me, nothing more
We are on a sullen misty moor
We may be dead and we may be gone
But we will be, we will be, we will be, right by your side
Until the day you die
This is no easy ride
We will haunt you when you laugh
Yes, you could say we're a team
You might sleep
You might sleep
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
Oh, you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"

Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for

Oh, find me, find me!
Find me!
I'll haunt you when you laugh
Oh, I'll haunt you when you laugh
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
Oh...
Over the moors, I'm on the moor
Oh, over the moor
Oh, the child is on the moor


The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
this town has dragged you down
oh the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
this town has dragged you down

And everybody's got to live their life
and God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine

William, William it was really nothing
William, William it was really nothing
it was your life

How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say:
"Would you like to marry me
and if you like you can buy the ring"
she doesn't care about anything
"Would you like to marry me
and if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone
except myself

William, William it was really nothing
William, William

My eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wonderkind
you took me behind a disused railway line
and said "I know a place where we can go
where we are not known"
and you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
and this is why you will never care
these things take time
I know that I'm
the most inept that ever slept

I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
and the hills are alive with celibate cries
but you know where you came from
you know where you're going
and you know where you belong
you said I was ill, and you were not wrong

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
and this is why you will never care
these things take time
I know that I'm
the most inept that ever slept

Oh the alcoholic afternoons
when we sat in your room
they meant more to me than any
than any living thing on earth
they had more worth
than any living thing on earth

Vivid and in your prime
you will leave me behind
you will leave me behind

All the streets are crammed with things
eager to be held
I know what hands are for
and I'd like to help myself
you ask me the time
but I sense something more
and I would like to give you
what I think you're asking for
you handsome devil
you handsome devil

Let me get my hands
on your mammary glands
and let me get your head
on the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

I crack the whip
and you skip
but you deserve it
you deserve it, deserve it, deserve it

A boy in the bush
is worth two in the hand
I think I can help you get through your exams
oh you handsome devil

Let me get my hands
on your mammary glands
and let me get your head
on the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

I crack the whip
and you skip
but you deserve it
you deserve it, deserve it, deserve it

And when we're in your scholarly room
who will swallow whom?
and when we're in your scholarly room
who will swallow whom?
you handsome devil

Let me get my hands
on your mammary glands
and let me get your head
on the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

There's more to life than books you know
but not much more
oh you handsome devil

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
"You've been in the house too long" she said
And I naturally fled

In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
"You've been in the house too long" she said
And I naturally fled

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

In a river the colour of lead
immerse a baby's head
wrap her up in the News Of The World
dump her on a doorstep, girl
this night has opened my eyes
and I will never sleep again

You kicked and cried like a bullied child
a grown man of twenty-five
he said he'd cure your ills
but he didn't and he never will
so, save your life
because you've only got one

The dream is gone
but the baby is real
oh you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh you did a bad thing
and I'm not happy
and I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
reminds you of your own again
she took away your troubles
oh but then again she left pain
so please save your life
because you've only got one

The dream is gone
but the baby is real
oh you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh you did a bad thing
and I'm not happy
and I'm not sad

Everyday you must say
so how do I feel about my life
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?

I am sick and I am dull
and I am plain
how dearly I'd love to get carried away
oh but dreams have a knack of just not coming true
and time is against me now

Who and what to blame?
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?
for heaven's sake
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
everyday you must say
how do I feel about the past

Others conquered love - but I ran
I sat in my room and I drew up a plan
but plans can fall through as so often they do
and time is against me now

And there's no one left to blame
tell me when will you
when will you accept your life
the one that you hate
for anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
everyday you must say
how do I feel about my shoes

They make me awkward and plain
how dearly I would love to kick with the fray
but I once had a dream and it never came true
and time is against me now
time is against me now

And there's no one but yourself to blame
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
anything is hard to find
for heaven's sake
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?
when?


Girl afraid
where does his intentions lay?
Or does he even have any?

She says:
"He never really looks at me
I give him every opportunity
in the room downstairs
he sat and stared
in the room downstairs
he sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again!"

Boy afraid
prudence never pays
and everything she wants costs money

"But she doesn't even LIKE me!
and I know because she said so
in the room downstairs
she sat and stared
in the room downstairs
she sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again!"

I would rather not go
back to the old house
I would rather not go
back to the old house
there's too many
bad memories
too many memories

When you cycled by
here began all my dreams
the saddest thing I've ever seen
and you never knew
how much I really liked you
because I never even told you
oh, but I meant to

Are you still there?
or have you moved away?
or have you moved away?

I would love to go
back to the old house
but I never will
I never will
I never will
I never will

Good times for a change
see, the luck I've had
can make a good man
turn bad

So please please please
let me, let me, let me
let me get what I want
this time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
see, the life I've had
can make a good man bad

So for once in my life
let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented minds
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
as a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
bruises bigger than dinner plates
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from the gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

The last night of the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is Famous
she is Funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass (money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night of the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said: "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said: "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology

I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face



A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor

A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor

A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was
thirteen
and someone that really impressed
me
it's written all over my face

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology

And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face


What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was sad
but then, all the rejections she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattooed boy from
Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)
What she said:
"I smoke 'cos I'm hoping for an
early death
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"

Angular 2 has a vocabulary of its own.
  Most Angular 2 terms are everyday English words
  with a specific meaning within the Angular system.

  We have gathered here the most prominent terms
  and a few less familiar ones that have unusual or
  unexpected definitions.


Component Lifecycle

A Component has a lifecycle managed by Angular itself. Angular creates it, renders it, creates and renders its children,
checks it when its data-bound properties change, and destroys it before removing it from the DOM.

Angular offers component lifecycle hooks
that give us visibility into these key moments and the ability to act when they occur.

We cover these hooks in this chapter and demonstrate how they work in code.

Directive and component instances have a lifecycle
as Angular creates, updates, and destroys them.

Developers can tap into key moments in that lifecycle by implementing
one or more of the Lifecycle Hook interfaces in the angular2/core library.

Each interface has a single hook method whose name is the interface name prefixed with `ng`.
For example, the `OnInit` interface has a hook method named `ngOnInit`.
We might implement it in a component class like this:

No directive or component will implement all of them and some of the hooks only make sense for components.

Angular only calls a directive/component hook method *if it is defined*.

The interfaces are optional for JavaScript and Typescript developers from a purely technical perspective.
The JavaScript language doesn't have interfaces.
Angular can't see TypeScript interfaces at runtime because they disappear from the transpiled JavaScript.

Fortunately, they aren't necessary.
We don't have to add the lifecycle hook interfaces to our directives and components to benefit from the hooks themselves.

Angular instead inspects our directive and component classes and calls the hook methods *if they are defined*.
Angular will find and call methods like `ngOnInit()`, with or without the interfaces.

Nonetheless, we strongly recommend adding interfaces to TypeScript directive classes
in order to benefit from strong typing and editor tooling.

Here are the component lifecycle hook methods:

Directives and Components

Initialize the directive/component after Angular initializes the data-bound input properties.

Respond after Angular sets a data-bound input property.
The method receives a `changes` object of current and previous values.

Detect and act upon changes that Angular can or won't
detect on its own. Called every change detection run.

Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive/component.
Unsubscribe observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks.

After Angular projects external content into its view.

After Angular checks the bindings of the external content that it projected into its view.

After Angular creates the component's view(s).

After Angular checks the bindings of the component's view(s).

Angular does not call the hook methods in this order.

*After* Angular creates a component/directive by `new`-ing its constructor,
it calls the lifecycle hook methods in the following sequence at specific moments:

before `ngOnInit` and when a data-bound input property value changes.

after the first `ngOnChanges`.

during every Angular change detection cycle.

after projecting content into the component.

after every check of projected component content.

after initializing the component's views and child views.

after every check of the component's views and child views.

 just before Angular destroys the directive/component.

Other Angular sub-system may have their own lifecycle hooks apart from the component hooks we've listed.
The router, for instance, also has it's own [router lifecycle hooks](router.html#router-lifecycle-hooks)
that allow us to tap into specific moments in route navigation.

A parallel can be drawn between `ngOnInit` and `routerOnActivate`.
Both are prefixed so as to avoid collision, and both run right when a component is 'booting' up.

3rd party libraries might implement their hooks as well in order to give us, the developers, more
control over how these libraries are used.

They follow a common pattern:  a *parent* component serves as a test rig for
a *child* component that illustrates one or more of the lifecycle hook methods.

Here's a brief description of each exercise:

Demonstrates every lifecycle hook.
Each hook method writes to the on-screen log.

Directives have lifecycle hooks too.
We create a `SpyDirective` that logs when the element it spies upon is
created or destroyed using the `ngOnInit` and `ngOnDestroy` hooks.

See how Angular calls the `ngOnChanges` hook with a `changes` object
every time one of the component input properties changes.
Shows how to interpret the `changes` object.

Implements a `ngDoCheck` method with custom change detection
that works because the data behave in a particularly simple way.
See how often Angular calls this hook and
watch it post changes to a log.

Demonstrates the `ngAfterViewInit` and `ngAfterViewChecked` hooks.

Shows how to project external content into a component and
how to distinguish projected content from a component's view children.
Demonstrates the `ngAfterContentInit` and `ngAfterContentChecked` hooks.

Demonstrates a combination of a component and a directive
each with its own hooks.

In this example, a `CounterComponent` logs a change (via `ngOnChanges`)
every time the parent component increments its input counter property.
Meanwhile, we apply the `SpyDirective` from the previous example
to the `CounterComponent` log and watch log entries be created and destroyed.

We discuss the exercises in further detail over this chapter as we learn more about the lifecycle hooks.

The `PeekABooComponent` demonstrates all of the hooks in one component.

In real life, we'd rarely if ever implement all of the interfaces like this.
We do so in peek-a-boo in order to watch Angular call the hooks in the expected order.

In this snapshot, we clicked the *Create...* button and then the *Destroy...* button.


The constructor isn't an Angular hook *per se*.
We log in it to confirm that input properties (the `name` property in this case) have no assigned values at construction.

Had we clicked the *Update Hero* button, we'd have seen another `OnChanges` and two more triplets of
`DoCheck, `AfterContentChecked` and `AfterViewChecked`.
Clearly these three hooks fire a *lot* and we must keep the logic we put in these hooks
as lean as possible!

Our next examples focus on hook details.

We're going undercover for these two hooks. We want to know when an element is initialized or destroyed,
but we don't want *it* to know we're watching.

This is the perfect infiltration job for a directive.
Our heroes will never know it's there.


Kidding aside, we're emphasizing two key points:

Angular calls hook methods for *directives* as well as components.

A spy directive can gives us insight into a DOM object that we cannot change directly.
Obviously we can't change the implementation of a native `div`.
We can't modify a third party component either.
But we can watch both with a directive.


Our sneaky spy directive is simple,  consisting almost entirely of `ngOnInit` and `ngOnDestroy` hooks
that log messages to the parent via an injected `LoggerService`.

We can apply the spy to any native or component element and it'll be initialized and destroyed
at the same time as that element.

Each spy's birth and death marks the birth and death of the attached hero `<div>`
with an entry in the *Hook Log* as we see here:



The *Reset* button clears the `heroes` list.
Angular removes all hero divs from the DOM and destroys their spy directives at the same time.
The spy's `ngOnDestroy` method reports its last moments.

The `ngOnInit` and `ngOnDestroy` methods have more vital roles to play in real applications.
Let's see why we need them.

We turn to `ngOnInit` for two main reasons:
To perform complex initializations shortly after construction
To set up the component after Angular sets the input properties

We don't fetch data in a component constructor. Why?
Because experienced developers agree that components should be cheap and safe to construct.
We shouldn't worry that a new component will try to contact a remote server when
created under test or before we decide to display it.
Constructors should do no more than set the initial local variables to simple values.

When a component must start working _soon_ after creation,
we can count on Angular to call the `ngOnit` method to jumpstart it.
That's where the heavy initialization logic belongs.

Remember also that a directive's data-bound input properties are not set until _after construction_.
That's a problem if we need to initialize the directive based on those properties.
They'll have been set when our `ngOninit` runs.

Our first opportunity to access those properties is the `ngOnChanges` method which
Angular calls before `ngOnit`. But Angular calls `ngOnChanges` many times after that.
It only calls `ngOnit` once.


Put cleanup logic in `ngOnDestroy`, the logic that *must* run before Angular destroys the directive.

This is the time to notify another part of the application that this component is going away.

This is the place to free resources that won't be garbage collected automatically.
Unsubscribe from observables and DOM events. Stop interval timers.
Unregister all callbacks that this directive registered with global or application services.
We risk memory leaks if we neglect to do so.

We monitor the `OnChanges` hook in this example.
Angular calls its `ngOnChanges` method whenever it detects changes to ***input properties*** of the component (or directive).

  Here is our implementation of the hook.

The input properties for our example `OnChangesComponent` are `hero` and `power`.

The parent binds to them like this:

Here's the sample in action as we make changes.

We see log entries as the string value of the *power* property changes. But the `ngOnChanges` did not catch changes to `hero.name`
That's surprising at first.

Angular only calls the hook when the value of the input property changes.
The value of the `hero` property is the *reference to the hero object*.
Angular doesn't care that the hero's own `name` property changed.
The hero object *reference* didn't change so, from Angular's perspective, there is no change to report!

We can take over the change detection with the `DoCheck` hook when Angular doesn't
catch an important change on its own.

We manually check everything that we care about, capturing and comparing against previous values.
We write a special message to the log when there are no substantive changes
to the hero or the power so we can keep an eye on the method's performance characteristics.

The results are illuminating:


We now are able to detect when the hero's `name` has changed. But we must be careful.

The `ngDoCheck` hook is called with enormous frequency &mdash;
after _every_ change detection cycle no matter where the change occurred.
It's called over twenty time in this example before the user can do anything.

Most of these initial checks are triggered by Angular's first rendering of *unrelated data elsewhere on the page*.
Mere mousing into another input box triggers a call.
Relatively few calls reveal actual changes to pertinent data.
Clearly our implementation must be very lightweight or the user experience may suffer.

The *AfterView* sample explores the `AfterViewInit` and `AfterViewChecked` hooks that Angular calls
*after* Angular creates a component's child views.

Here's a child view that displays a hero's name in an input box:

The `AfterViewComponent` displays this child view *within its template*:

The following hooks take action based on changing values *within the child view*
which we can only reach by querying for the child view via the property decorated with @ViewChild.


Abide by the unidirectional data flow rule
The `_doSomething` method updates the screen when the hero name exceeds 10 characters.

Why does the `_doSomething` method waits a tick w/ `setTimeout` before updating `comment`?

We must adhere to Angular's unidirectional data flow rule which says that
we may not update the view *after* it has been composed.
Both hooks fire after the component's view has been composed.

Angular throws an error if we update component's data-bound `comment` property immediately (try it!).
The `setTimeout` postpones the update one turn of the of the browser's JavaScript cycle ... and that's long enough.

Here's *AfterView* in action

Notice that Angular frequently calls `AfterViewChecked`, often when there are no changes of interest.
Write lean hook methods to avoid performance problems.


The *AfterContent* sample explores the `AfterContentInit` and `AfterContentChecked` hooks that Angular calls
*after* Angular projects external content into the component.

*Content projection* is a way to import HTML content from outside the component and insert that content
into the component's template in a designated spot.

Angular 1 developers know this technique as *transclusion*.

We'll illustrate with a variation on the previous example
whose behavior and output is almost the same.

This time, instead of including the child view within the template, we'll import it from
the `AfterContentComponent`'s parent. Here's the parent's template.

Notice that the `<child-view>` tag is tucked between the `<after-content>` tags.
We never put content between a component's element tags *unless we intend to project that content
into the component*.

Now look at the component's template:

The `<ngContent>` tags are the *placeholder* for the external content.
They tell Angular where to insert that content.
In this case, the projected content is the `<child-view>` from the parent.

  The tell-tale signs of *content projection* are (a) HTML between component element tags
  and (b) the presence of `<ngContent>` tags in the component's template.

*AfterContent* hooks are similar to the *AfterView* hooks. The key difference is the kind of child component
that we're looking for.

* The *AfterView* hooks concern `ViewChildren`, the child components whose element tags
appear *within* the component's template.

* The *AfterContent* hooks concern `ContentChildren`, the child components that Angular
projected into the component.

The following *AfterContent* hooks take action based on changing values in a  *content child*
which we can only reach by querying for it via the property decorated with @ContentChild.

No unidirectional flow worries

 This component's `_doSomething` method update's the component's data-bound `comment` property immediately.
 There's no need to wait.

 Recall that Angular calls both *AfterContent* hooks before calling either of the *AfterView* hooks.
 Angular completes composition of the projected content *before* finishing the composition of this component's view.
 We still have a window of opportunity to modify that view.

 One of the defining features of a single page application is its manipulation
 of the DOM tree. Instead of serving a whole new page every time a user
 navigates, whole sections of the DOM appear and disappear according
 to the application state. In this chapter we'll to look at how Angular
 manipulates the DOM and how we can do it ourselves in our own directives.

What are structural directives?

 There are three kinds of Angular directives:
 1. Components
 1. Attribute directives
 1. Structural directives

 The *Component* is really a directive with a template.
 It's the most common of the three directives and we write lots of them as we build our application.

 The *Attribute* directive changes the appearance or behavior of an element.
 The built-in NgStyle directive, for example,
 can change several element styles at the same time.
 We can use it to render text bold, italic, and lime green by binding to a
 component property that requests such a sickening result.

 A *Structural* directive changes the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
 We've seen three of the built-in structural directives in other chapters.

 Let’s focus on `ngIf`. It's a great example of a structural
 directive: it takes a boolean and makes an entire chunk of DOM appear
 or disappear.

The `ngIf` directive does not hide the element.
Using browser developer tools we can see that, when the condition is true, the top
paragraph is in the DOM and the bottom disused paragraph is completely
absent from the DOM! In its place are empty `<script>` tags.

### Why *remove* rather than *hide*?
We could hide the unwanted paragraph by setting its css `display` style to `none`.
The element would remain in the DOM while invisible. Instead we removed it with `ngIf`.

The difference matters. When we hide an element,
the component's behavior continues.
It remains attached to its DOM element. It continues to listen to events.
Angular keeps checking for changes that could affect data bindings.
Whatever the component was doing it keeps doing.

Although invisible, the component &mdash; and all of its descendent components
tie up resources that might be more useful elsewhere.
The performance and memory burden can be substantial and the user may not benefit at all.

On the positive side, showing the element again is very quick.
The component's previous state is preserved and ready to display.
The component doesn't re-initialize &mdash; an operation that could be expensive.

 `ngIf` is different.
 Setting `ngIf` to false **does** affect the component's resource consumption.
 Angular removes the element from DOM, stops change detection for the associated component,
 detaches it from DOM events (the attachments that it made) and destroys the component.
 The component can be garbage-collected (we hope) and free up memory.

Components often have child components which themselves have children.
All of them are destroyed when `ngIf` destroys the common ancestor.
This cleanup effort is usually a good thing.

Of course it isn't *always* a good thing.
It might be a bad thing if we need that particular component again soon.

The component's state might be expensive to re-construct.
When `ngIf` becomes `true` again, Angular recreates the component and its subtree.
Angular runs every component's initialization logic again. That could be expensive ... as when
a component re-fetches data that had been in memory just moments ago.

*Design thought*: minimize initialization effort and consider caching state in a
companion service.

Although there are pros and cons to each approach,
in general it is best to use `ngIf` to remove unwanted components rather than
hide them.

**These same considerations apply to every structural directive, whether built-in or custom.**
We should ask ourselves &mdash; and the users of our directives &mdash; to think carefully
about the consequences of adding and removing elements and of creating and destroying components.

Let's see these dynamics at work. For fun, we'll stack the deck *against*
our recommendation and consider a component called `heavy-loader` that
***pretends*** to load a ton of data when initialized.

We'll display two instances of the component.  We toggle the visibility of the first one with CSS.
We toggle the second into and out of the DOM with `ngIf`.

We also log when a component is created or destroyed
using the built-in `ngOnInit` and `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hooks.
Here it is in action:

Both components are in the DOM at the start.
First we toggle the component's visibility repeatedly. The component never leaves the DOM.
When visible it's always the same instance and the log is quiet.

Then we toggle the second component with `ngIf`.
We create a new instance every time and the log shows that we're paying
a heavy price to create and destroy it.

If we really expected to "wink" the component like this, toggling visibility would be the better choice.
In most UIs, when we "close" a component we're unlikely see it again for a long time, if ever.
The `ngIf` would be preferred in that case.

Structural directives, like `ngIf`, do their magic by using the
HTML 5 template tag.


Inside of an app, Angular ***removes*** the`<template>` tags and their children.
The contents are gone &mdash; but not forgotten as we'll see soon.

We can confirm these effects by wrapping the middle "hip" of the phrase "Hip! Hip! Hooray!" within a `<template>` tag.

 The display is a 'Hip!' short of perfect enthusiasm. The DOM effects are different when Angular is control.

Evidently Angular replaces the `<template>` tag and its contents with empty `<script>` tags.
That's just its default behavior.
It can do something different as we saw when applying a variety of `ngSwitch` directives to `<template>` tags:

When one of those `ngSwitch` conditions is true, Angular inserts the template's content into the DOM.

What does this have to do with `ngIf` and `ngFor`?  We didn't use a `<template>` tag with those directives.

Here are those directives again. See the difference?

We're prefixing these directive names with an asterisk (\*).

The asterisk is "syntactic sugar". It simplifies `ngIf` and `ngFor` for both the writer and the reader.
Under the hood, Angular replaces the asterisk version with a more verbose `<template>` form.

The next two `ngIf` examples are effectively the same and we may write in either style:

Most of us would rather write in style (A).

It's worth knowing that Angular expands style (A) into style (B).
It moves the paragraph and its contents inside a `<template>` tag.
It moves the directive up to the `<template>` tag where it becomes a property binding,
surrounded in square brackets. The boolean value of the host component's `condition` property
determines whether the templated content is displayed or not.

Angular transforms `*ngFor` in a similar manner:

The basic pattern is the same:&nbsp; create a `<template>`, relocate the content,
and move the directive onto the `<template>`.

There are extra nuances stemming from
Angular's ngFor micro-syntax which expands
into an additional `ngForOf` property binding (the iterable) and
 the `#hero` local template variable
(the current item in each iteration).


Make a structural directive
Let's write our own structural directive, an `Unless` directive, the not-so-evil twin of `ngIf`.

Unlike `ngIf` which displays the template content when `true`,
our directive displays the content when the condition is ***false***.

Creating a directive is similar to creating a component.
* import the `Directive` decorator.

* add a CSS **attribute selector** (in brackets) that identifies our directive.

* specify the name of the public `input` property for binding
(typically the name of the directive itself).

* apply the decorator to our implementation class.

Here is how we begin:


 The CSS syntax for selecting an attribute is a name in square brackets.
 We surround our directive name in square brackets. See *Directive configuration* on the

 ### Selector name prefixes

We recommend picking a selector name with a prefix to ensure
 that it cannot conflict with any standard HTML attribute, now or in the future.

We do **not** prefix our `unless` directive name with **`ng`**.
That prefix belongs to Angular and
we don't want to confuse our directives with their directives.

Our prefix is `my`.

We'll need access to the template *and* something that can render its contents.
We access the template with a `TemplateRef`.  The renderer is a `ViewContainerRef`.
We inject both into our constructor as private variables.

The consumer of our directive will bind a `true` | `false` value to our directive's `myUnless` input property.
The directive adds or removes the template based on that value.

Let's add the `myUnless` property now as a setter-only

The `@Input()` annotation marks this property as an input for the directive.

Nothing fancy here: if the condition is false,
we render the template, otherwise we clear the element content.

The end result should look like below:

Now we add it to the `directives` array of the host component and try it.
First we add some test HTML to the template:


We run it and it behaves as expected, doing the opposite of `ngIf`.
When `condition` is `true`, the top paragraph is removed (replaced by `<script>` tags) and the bottom paragraph appears.

Our `myUnless` directive is dead simple. Surely we left something out.
Surely `ngIf` is more complex?

Look at the source code.
It's well documented and we shouldn't be shy
about consulting the source when we want to know how something works.

`ngIf` isn't much different! There are a few
additional checks to improve performance (don't clear or recreate the
view unless necessary) but otherwise it's much the same.

Here is the pertinent source for this chapter.

We learned that we can manipulate our HTML layout with
structural directives like `ngFor` and `ngIf` and we
wrote our own structural directive, `myUnless`, to do something similar.

Angular offers more sophisticated techniques for managing layout
such as *structural components* that can take external content
and incorporate that content within their own templates.
Tab and tab pane controls are good examples.

We'll learn about structural components in a future chapter.

When the user clicks a link, pushes a button, or enters text
we want to know about it. These user actions all raise DOM events.
In this chapter we learn to bind to those events using the Angular
event binding syntax.

## Binding to user input events

 We can use Angular event bindings
 to respond to any DOM event.

The syntax is simple. We surround the DOM event name in parentheses and assign a quoted template statement to it.
As an example, here's an event binding that implements a click handler:

The `(click)` to the left of the equal sign identifies the button's click event as the **target of the binding**.
The text within quotes on the right is the **template statement** in which we
respond to the click event by calling the component's `onClickMe` method. A template statement is a subset
of JavaScript with restrictions and a few added tricks.

When writing a binding we must be aware of a template statement's **execution context**.
The identifiers appearing within a statement belong to a specific context object.
That object is usually the Angular component that controls the template  ... which it definitely is
in this case because that snippet of HTML belongs to the following component:

When the user clicks the button, Angular calls the component's `onClickMe` method.

## Get user input from the $event object
We can bind to all kinds of events. Let's bind to the keyup event of an input box and replay
what the user types back onto the screen.

This time we'll (1) listen to an event and (2) grab the user's input.

Angular makes an event object available in the **`$event`** variable,
which we pass to the component's `onKey()` method.
The user data we want is in that variable somewhere.

The shape of the `$event` object is determined by whatever raises the event.
The `keyup` event comes from the DOM, so `$event` must be a standard DOM event object.
The `$event.target` gives us an `HTMLInputElement`, which
 has a `value` property that contains our user input data.

The `onKey()` component method is where we extract the user's input
from the event object, adding that input to the list of user data that we're accumulating in the component's `values` property.
We then use interpolation
to display the accumulating `values` property back on screen.

Enter the letters "abc", and then backspace to remove them.
Here's what the UI displays:

We cast the `$event` as an `any` type, which means we've abandoned strong typing
to simplify our code. We generally prefer the strong typing that TypeScript affords.
We can rewrite the method, casting to HTML DOM objects like this.

Strong typing reveals a serious problem with passing a DOM event into the method:
too much awareness of template details, too little separation of concerns.

We'll address this problem in our next try at processing user keystrokes.

## Get user input from a local template variable
There's another way to get the user data without the `$event` variable.

Angular has a syntax feature called **local template variables**.
These variables grant us direct access to an element.
We declare a local template variable by preceding an identifier with a hash/pound character (#).

Here's an example of using a local template variable
to implement a clever keystroke loopback in an ultra-simple template.

We've declared a template local variable named `box` on the `<input>` element.
The `box` variable is a reference to the `<input>` element itself, which means we can
grab the input element's `value` and display it
with interpolation between `<p>` tags.

The template is completely self contained. It doesn't bind to the component,
and the component does nothing.

Type in the input box, and watch the display update with each keystroke. *Voila!*

 **This won't work at all unless we bind to an event**.

Angular only updates the bindings (and therefore the screen)
if we do something in response to asynchronous events such as keystrokes.

That's why we bind the `keyup` event to a statement that does ... well, nothing.
We're binding to the number 0, the shortest statement we can think of.
That is all it takes to keep Angular happy. We said it would be clever!

That local template variable is intriguing. It's clearly easier to get to the textbox with that
variable than to go through the `$event` object. Maybe we can rewrite our previous
keyup example so that it uses the variable to get the user's input. Let's give it a try.

That sure seems easier.
An especially nice aspect of this approach is that our component code gets clean data values from the view.
It no longer requires knowledge of the `$event` and its structure.


## Key event filtering (with `key.enter`)

Perhaps we don't care about every keystroke.
Maybe we're only interested in the input box value when the user presses Enter, and we'd like to ignore all other keys.
When we bind to the `(keyup)` event, our event handling statement hears *every keystroke*.
We could filter the keys first, examining every `$event.keyCode`, and update the `values` property only if the key is Enter.

Angular can filter the key events for us. Angular has a special syntax for keyboard events.
We can listen for just the Enter key by binding to Angular's `keyup.enter` pseudo-event.

 Only then do we update the component's `values` property. (In this example,
 the update happens inside the event binding statement. A better practice
 would be to put the update code in the component.)

       Here's how it works.

       ## On blur

       Our previous example won't transfer the current state of the input box if the user mouses away and clicks
       elsewhere on the page. We update the component's `values` property only when the user presses Enter
       while the focus is inside the input box.

       Let's fix that by listening to the input box's blur event as well.


## Put it all together
We learned how to display data in the previous chapter.
We've acquired a small arsenal of event binding techniques in this chapter.

Let's put it all together in a micro-app
that can display a list of heroes and add new heroes to that list.
The user can add a hero by first typing in the input box and then
pressing Enter, clicking the Add button, or clicking elsewhere on the page.

Below is the "Little Tour of Heroes"  component.
We'll call out the highlights after we bask briefly in its minimalist glory.

We've seen almost everything here before. A few things are new or bear repeating.

### Use template variables to refer to elements

The `newHero` template variable refers to the `<input>` element.
We can use `newHero` from any sibling or child of the `<input>` element.

Getting the element from a template variable makes the button click handler
simpler. Without the variable, we'd have to use a fancy CSS selector
to find the input element.

### Pass values, not elements

We could have passed the `newHero` into the component's `addHero` method.

But that would require `addHero` to pick its way through the `<input>` DOM element,
something we learned to dislike in our first try at a keyup component.

Instead, we grab the input box *value* and pass *that* to `addHero`.
The component knows nothing about HTML or the DOM, which is the way we like it.

### Keep template statements simple
We bound `(blur)` to *two* JavaScript statements.

We like the first one, which calls `addHero`.
We do not like the second one, which assigns an empty string to the input box value.

The second statement exists for a good reason. We have to clear the input box after adding the new hero to the list.
The component has no way to do that itself because it has no access to the
input box (our design choice).

Although the example *works*, we are rightly wary of JavaScript in HTML.
Template statements are powerful. We're supposed to use them responsibly.
Complex JavaScript in HTML is irresponsible.

Should we reconsider our reluctance to pass the input box into the component?

There should be a better third way. And there is, as we'll see when we learn about `NgModel` in the Forms chapter.

Here is all the code we talked about in this chapter.

We've mastered the basic primitives for responding to user input and gestures.
As powerful as these primitives are, they are a bit clumsy for handling
large amounts of user input. We're operating down at the low level of events when
we should be writing two-way bindings between data entry fields and model properties.

Angular has a two-way binding called `NgModel`, which we'll learn about
in the `Forms` chapter.



World peace is none of your business
You must not tamper with arrangements
Work hard and sweetly pay your taxes
Never asking what for
Oh, you poor little fool- oh, you fool

World peace is none of your business
Police will stun you with their stun guns
Or they'll disable you with tasers
That's what government's for
Oh, you poor little fool- oh, you fool

World peace is none of your business
So would you kindly keep your nose out
The rich must profit and get richer
And the poor must stay poor
Oh, you poor little fool- oh, you fool

Each time you vote you support the process
Each time you vote you support the process
Each time you vote you support the process
Brazil and Bahrain
Oh, Egypt, Ukraine
So many people in pain
No more, you poor little fool
No more, you fool


Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg’s tears shampoo his beard
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg’s lips tighten and thin
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg’s hosed down in a barn
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg’s howl becomes a growl
Everyone has babies
Babies full of rabies
Rabies full of scabies
Scarlet has a fever
Ring’s [?] full of ringworm
Angel of disdain
Poor little fella has got rubella
Liver full of fungus
Junior full of gangrene
Mine is melanoma
Tikes full of gripe.
Whippersnapper’s scurvy
Urchin made of acne
Get that thing away from me
Victim, or life’s adventurer
Which of the two are you?
Victim or life’s adventurer
Which of the two are you?

When he first cried, his mother died. I had tried to be his guide
When he was born I was too young, the father searches for the son

In Istanbul.
Give him back to me
In Istanbul.
Give me back my brown eyed son.

Moonlight jumping through the trees, sunken eyes avoiding me.
From dawn to dusk the hunt is on, the father searches for the son.

In Istanbul
Give him back to me
In Istanbul
Give me back my brown eyed son

On secret streets in disbelief, little shadow shows the lead
Prostitutes stylish and glum, in amongst them you are one
Oh what have I done...

Rolling breathless off the tongue the vicious street gang slang
I lean into a box of pine, identify the kid as mine...

Don Juan
Picaresque
Wife beater vest
Cold hand
Ice man
Warring cave man
Well if this is what it takes to describe...
I'm not a man

Wheeler, dealer
Mover, shaker
Casanova
Beefaroni
A-ho but lonely
Well if this is what it takes to describe...
I'm not a man
I'm not a man
I'm something much bigger and better than
A man

Wise-ass
Smart-ass
Workaholic
Thick-skinned
Two-fisted hombre, olé
Well if these are terms you'd use to describe...

Oh, I'm shaking
Look at me I'm quaking
True grit
True blue
Kill crazy
So very manly of you
You are the soldier
Who won't get much older
You are the slow Joe
Who signed up to go

Wolf down
Wolf down
T-bone steak
Wolf down
Cancer of the prostate

Ways to sit
And of course
Ways to stand
I'm not a man
I'm not a man
No big fat locker room
Hockey jock
Laughing
I'm not a man
I'd never kill or eat an animal
And I never would destroy this planet I'm on
Well, what do you think I am?
A man?

Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all

Day after day you say "one day, one day"
Day after day you say "one day, one day"
But you're in the wrong place
and you've got the wrong face
And humans are not really very humane
And earth is the loneliest planet of all

Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Live with a lowness that no one else knows
Time after time you say "next time, next time"
Time after time you say "next time, next time"
But you fail as a woman
and you lose as a man
We do what we can
And earth is the cruelest place
you will never understand

But you're in the wrong skin
And the skin that you're in
Says "oh, let it begin"
And earth is the loneliest planet of all

Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all

Day after day you say "one day, one day"
Day after day you say "one day, one day"
And there's always a reason why you're refused
They always blame "you, you, you"
And there is nothing anyone can do



March, April, May
She crammed night and day
I hadn't seen her smile in a while

March, April, May

Staircase at the university
She threw herself down and her head split three ways

"If you don't get three As," her sweet daddy said
You're no child of mine and as far as I'm concerned, you're dead
"If you don't get three As," her sweet daddy said
You're no child of mine and as far as I'm concerned, you're dead

"If you don't get three As," her lovely boyfriend said
Your shame is sure to stain the family name
"If you don't get three As," her lovely boyfriend said

Staircase at the university

Crammin', jammin', pack-em-in rammin'
Chock-a-block box, power study, polish up
And if it breaks your heart then don't come running to me

Crammin', jammin', pack-em-in rammin'
Chock-a-block box, power study, polish up
And if it breaks your legs then don't come running to me

Mad in Madrid
Ill in Seville
Lonely in Barcelona
Then someone told you and you cheer

Hooray, hooray
The bullfighter dies
Hooray, hooray
The bullfighter dies
And nobody cries
Nobody cries
Because we all want the bull to survive

Gaga in Málaga
No mercy in Murcia
Mental in Valencia
Then someone tells you and you cheer

And nobody cries

Because we all want the bull to survive



Bastille mausoleum
Stockyard, churchyard
Your mammy's backyard

I don't care when or where
I just care that you're there
And that you will...

Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over my face
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over the place
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over and then when you've kissed me
Kiss me all over again

Bastille mausoleum
Stockyard, churchyard
Your mammy's backyard

I don't care when or where
I only care that the two of us are there
And that you, and that you will...

Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over my face
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over the place
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over and then when you've kissed me
Kiss me all over again

Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over my face
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
All over the place
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
I don't care where or when but when you've kissed me
Kiss me all over again

See in me the side of you

That sometimes makes you jump with fright
Smiler with knife it's your big night

Sinking bed, all warm and clean
Only sadness waits for me
Smiler with knife you're just in time
You're just in time

Press the blade against my skin
Never to make love again
Smiler with knife it's alright

Surrender will I am before you
I am sick to death of life
Smiler with knife, alight
Alight

If such things weren't meant to be
Then they would never come to me
Smiler, oh, don't worry so

Slamming one shots, gentle pain
Someone calling out my name
Sex and love are not the same
Are not the same

Time has frittered long and slow
All I am and was will go
But where to and why now?

When my last breath falls away
Smiler, trust me when I say: "You'll be OK" "You'll be OK"



Kick the bride down the aisle

And make no mistake
It's the best you can do for everyone's sake

Kick the bride down the aisle
And treasure the day
I know so much more than I'm willing to say

She just wants a slave
To break his back in pursuit of a living wage
So that she can laze and graze
For the rest of her days
Write down every word I say

Kick the bride down the aisle
In a mudslide of gloom
She'll order you to tidy your room

Kick the bride down the aisle
Look at that cow in the field
It knows more than your bride knows now

She just wants a slave
To break his back in pursuit of a living wage
So that she can laze and graze
For the rest of her days
Write down every word I say

You're that stretch of the beach
That the tide doesn't reach
No meaning, no reason
The lonely season

Kick the bride down the aisle
And treasure the day

The joy brings many things

It cannot bring you joy
Sons of mothers huddle here
Men and boys

1850 swung the doors
And human sewage swept inside
Where victims speak in whines
And where the hardened cried

I was sent here by a 3 foot half-wit in a wig
I took his insults on the chin, and never did I flinch

A swagger hides the fear in here
By this rule we breathe
And there is no one on this earth
Who I’d feel sad to leave

You see we all lose
We all lose

What those in power do to you
Reminds us at a glance
How humans hate each others guts
And show it given a chance

We never say aloud the things
That we say in our prayers
Cause no one cares

Many executed here
By the awful lawfully good
But the only thing that makes me cry
Is when I see the sky

Brendan Behan's laughter rings
For what he had or hadn’t done
For he knew then as I know now
That for each and every one of us
We all lose
Rich or poor, we all lose
Rich or poor, they all lose



Oboe concerto

All the best ones are dead
And there's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head

There's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head

Oboe concerto
All I do is drink to absent friends
And there's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head

There's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head

The older generation have tried, sighed & died
Which pushes me to their place in the queue

Round, rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round


America, your head's too big
Because, America,
Your belly's too big
And I love you, I just wish you'd stay where you is

In America
The land of the Free, they said
And of Opportunity
In a just and a truthful way
But where the President
Is never black, female or gay
And until that day
You've got nothing to say to me
To help me believe
In America

"It brought you the hamburger"
Well. America, you know where
You can shove your hamburger
And don't you wonder
Why in Estonia they say
"Hey you, Big fat pig
You fat pig, You fat pig"

Steely-blue eyes with no love in them
Scan The World
And a humourless smile
With no warmth within
Greets the world
And I, I have got nothing
To offer you
No-no-no-no-no
Just this heart deep and true
Which you say you don't need

See with your eyes
Touch with your hands, please
Hear through your ears
Know in your soul, please
For haven't you me with you now?
And I love you, I love you, I love you
And I love you, I love you, I love you

Irish blood, English heart
This I'm made of
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
And no regime can buy or sell me

I've been dreaming of a time when
to be English is not to be baneful
to be standing by the flag, not feeling shameful
racist or partial

Irish blood, English heart
this I'm made of
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
And I will die with both of my hands untied

I've been dreaming of a time when
the English are sick to death
of Labour, and Tories
and spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell
and denounce this royal line that still salute him
and will salute him
Forever...



I was a good kid
I wouldn't do you no harm
I was a nice kid
With a nice paper round

Forgive me any pain
I may have brung to you
With God's help I know
I'll always be near to you

But Jesus hurt me
When he deserted me, but
I have forgiven Jesus
For all the desire
He placed in me when there's nothing
I can do with this desire

I was a good kid
Through hail and snow
I'd go just to moon you
I carried my heart in my hand
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

But Jesus hurt me
When He deserted me, but
I have forgiven Jesus
For all of the love
He placed in me when there's no one
I can turn to with this love

Monday - humiliation
Tuesday - suffocation
Wednesday - condescension
Thursday - is pathetic
By Friday life has killed me
By Friday life has killed me

Oh pretty one
Oh pretty one

Why did you give me so much desire
When there is nowhere I can go to offload this desire?
And why did you give me so much love in a loveless world
When there is no one I can turn to
To unlock all this love?
And why did you stick me in self deprecating bones and skin?
Jesus do you hate me?
Why did you stick me in self deprecating bones and skin?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?



There is something I wanted to tell you
It's so funny you'll kill yourself laughing
But then I, I look around
And I remember that I am alone
Alone
For evermore

The tile yard all along the railings
Up a discoloured dark brown staircase
Here you'll find, despair and I
Calling to you with what's left of my heart
My heart
For evermore

Drinking tea with the taste of the Thames
Sullenly on a chair on the pavement
Here you'll find, my thoughts and I
And here is the very last plea from my heart
My heart
For evermore

Where taxi drivers never stop talking
Under slate grey Victorian sky,
Here you will find, despair and I
And here I am every last inch of me is yours,
Yours
For evermore

Your leg came to rest against mine
Then you lounged with knees up and apart
And me and my heart, we knew
We just knew
For evermore

Where taxi drivers never stop talking
Under slate grey Victorian sky
Here you'll find, my heart and I
And still we say come back
Come back to Camden
And I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be good


On returning
I can't believe this world is still turning
The pressure's on
Because the pleasure hasn't gone
And I'm
Not sorry for
For the things I've done
And I'm
Not looking for
Just anyone

On competing
Oh, when will this tired heart stop beating?
It's all a game
Existence is only a game
And I'm
Not sorry for
For the things I've done
And I'm
Not looking for
Just anyone

I'm
Slipping below the water line
I'm
Slipping below the water line
Reach for my hand
And, and the race is won
Reject my hand
And the damage is done

I'm
Slipping below the water line
I'm
Slipping below the water line

The woman of my dreams
She, she never came along
The woman of my dreams
Well, there never was one

And I'm
Not sorry for
For the things I've said
There's a wild man in my head
There's a wild man
In my head



You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care, but don't stare
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
They who wish to hurt you
Work within the law

This world is full, oh
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
and love me"

You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care and say a prayer
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen,
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
Educated criminals work within the law

This world is full
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms and love me
And love me"

What really lies
Beyond the constraints of my mind?
Could it be the sea
With fate mooning back at me?
No, it's just more lock-jawed pop-stars
Thicker than pig-shit
Nothing to convey
So scared to show intelligence
It might smear their lovely career

This world - I am afraid -
Is designed for crashing bores
I am not one
I am not one
You don't understand
You don't understand

And yet you can
Take me in your arms and love me, love me
And love me
Take me in your arms and love me, love me, love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Would you do, would you do what you should do?


She told me she loved me
Which means
She must be insane
I've had my face dragged in
Fifteen miles of shit
And I do not, And I do not
And I do not like it
So how can anybody say
They know how I feel
The only one around here who is me
Is me

They said they respect me
Which means
Their judgement is crazy
I've had my face dragged in
Fifteen miles of shit
And I do not And I do not
And I do not like it
So how can anybody say
They know how I feel
When they are they
And only I am I

He said he wants to befriend me
Which means
He can't possibly know me
The voices of the real
And the imagined cry:
"The future is passing you by
The future is passing you by"

So how can anybody possibly think they know how I feel?
Everybody look, see pain and walk away
And as for you in your uniform
Your smelly uniform
You think you can be rude to me
Because you wear a uniform
A smelly uniform
And so you think you can be rude to me

But even I, as sick as I am, I would never be you
Even I, as sick as I am, I would never be you
Even I, sick and depraved, a traveller to the grave
I would never be you
I would never be you




You have never been in love
until you've seen the stars
reflect in the reservoirs

And you have never been in love
until you've seen the dawn rise
behind the Home for the Blind

We are the Pretty Petty Thieves
and you're standing on our streets
where Hector was the
first of the gang with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die, oh my

Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die, oh my

You have never been in love
until you've seen the sunlight thrown
over smashed human bone

We are the Pretty Petty Thieves
and you're standing on our streets
where Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die
Such a silly boy

Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and a bullet in his gullet
and the first lost lad
to go under the sod

And he stole from the rich and the poor
and the not very rich and the very poor
and he stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
Away...
He stole all hearts away
Away...



There's a place in the sun for anyone
Who has the will
To chase one and I think I've found mine
Yes, I do believe I have found mine

So, close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh
Let me kiss you, oh

I zig-zagged all over America
And I cannot find a safety haven
Say, would you let me cry on your shoulder
I've heard that you'll try anything twice

Close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh
Let me kiss you, oh

But then you open your eyes
And you see someone that you physically despise
But my heart is open
My heart is open to you


All the lazy dykes
Cross-armed at the Palms
Then legs astride their bikes
Indigo burns on their arms

One sweet day
An emotional whirl
You will be good to yourself
And you'll come and join the girls

All the lazy dykes
They pity how you live
Just "somebody's wife"
You give, and you give,
And you give, and you give
Give, and you give
And one sweet day
An emotional whirl
You will be good to yourself
And you'll come and join the girls

Touch me, squeeze me
Hold me too tightly
And when you look at me you actually see me
And I've never felt so alive
In the whole of my life
In the whole of my life

Free yourself, be yourself
Come to the Palms and see yourself
And at last your life begins
At last your life begins
At last your life begins
At last your life begins



Something in you caused me to
take a new tack with you
You were going through something
I had just about scraped through
Why do you think I let you get away
with the things you say to me?

Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you

No one I ever knew
or have spoken to resembles you
This is good or bad
all depending on my general mood
Why do you think I let you get away
with all the things you say to me?

Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you

Magistrates who spend their lives
hiding their mistakes
They look at you and I
and envy makes them cry
Envy makes them cry

Forces of containment
They shove their fat faces into mine
You and I just smile
because we're thinking the same line
Why do you think I let you get away
with all the things you say to me?

Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you

You're not right in the head
and nor am I, and this is why
You're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why

This is why I like you, I like you, I like you
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you
Because you're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why
You're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you...


The whispering
May hurt you
But the printed word might kill you

The whispering
May hurt you
But the printed word might kill you

So don't let the blue
The blue eyes fool you
They're just gelignite
Loaded and aiming right between your eyes
CDs and T-shirts, promos and God knows
You know I couldn't last
Someone please take me home

The teenagers
Who love you
They will wake up, yawn and kill you

The teenagers
Who love you
They will wake up, yawn and kill you

So don't let the blue
The blue eyes fool you
They're just gelignite
Loaded and aiming right between your eyes
CDs and T-shirts, promos and God knows
You know I couldn't last
Someone please take me home

There's a cash register ringing and
It weighs so heavy on my back
Someone please take me home

The critics who
Can't break you
They somehow help to make you

The critics who
Can't break you
Unwittingly they make you

So don't let the good days
Of the gold discs
Creep up and mug you
With evil legal eagles
You know I couldn't last
Accountants rampant
You know I couldn't last
Every -ist and every -ism
Thrown my way to stay

And the Northern leeches go on
Removing, removing, removing

Then in the end
Your royalties bring you luxuries
Your royalties bring you luxuries
Oh but
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind



Long ago when he was young and restless
Suddenly Daddy saw the beckoning finger of fate

Don't make fun of Daddy's voice
Because he can't help it
When he was a teenage boy
Something got stuck in his throat

When you are young you crave affection
And it can come from the strangest direction

Don't make fun of Daddy's voice
Because he can't help it
When he was teenage boy
Something got stuck in his throat

Don't make fun of Daddy's voice
Because he can't help it
When he was teenage boy
Something got stuck in his throat

(No te diviertes con Papi?)


"I can kill standing still - it's easy
I can scare with a stare - it's easy"
Hey Ringo, it's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall when you're small
Whether dressed in disciplined style, nevermind
When you're small you walk as if you're falling

"I attack from the back - because it's easy
And I can assail while wearing very nice jewellery"
Oh, hey Ringo, it's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall when you're small
Whether dressed in disciplined style, nevermind
When you're small you spend your life crawling

"I burst into public bars
and I throw my weight around
And no one can even see me
No one can even see me
Nobody can see me
No one can see me"

"Success is just a mess!"
Oh, hey Gringo, it's sad though
because it's hard to walk tall when you're small
whether dressed in disciplined style, nevermind
when you're small you're bound to look appalling

"So compadre, please do this for me
Compadre, please weep for me
Compadre, compadre
Please, weep for me"



You chase in the rat-race
And you always feel so hollow
You marry because it's expected of you
And it only makes you feel more lonely

But still you look down on the teenage dad on
On his estate
He's happy so leave him alone
With his baby
And his modest home
He's happy so leave him alone
With his Jensen Interceptor
It's just a runaround

You defer to the views of the television news
Let someone do your thinking for you
And you still buy a daily newspaper
And you find everything there but the news

And still you look down on the teenage dad on
On his estate
He's happy so leave him alone
With his baby
And his modest home
He's happy so leave him alone
With his Jensen Interceptor
It's just a runaround

You become your parents' parent
And you love them
But you can't help feeling used
And you hate the teenage dad on his estate
Because he's poor but he's happier than you
They're all laughing at you
You're a dipper, a slider, cart-horse provider
Nobody cares about you
Just as long as you're out there bringing it in
Despising the grin on the face of the boy
With the methadone
With his methadone
He's happy so leave him alone
With his methadone
He's happy so leave him alone



We love them
We mourn for them
Unlucky boys of Red

I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where Mother Nature makes their bed

We miss them
Every night we kiss them
Their faces fixed in our heads

I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where Mother Nature makes their bed

They can't hurt you
Their style will never desert you
Because they're all safely dead

I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where Mother Nature makes their bed



Friday mourning, I'm dressed in black
Douse the house lights, I'm not coming back
For years, I warned you
Through tears, I told you
Friday mourning, there comes a time
Before that breaks this very smug mug of mine

This dawn raid soon put paid to
All the things I'd whispered to you
At night time
And I will never stand naked in front of you
Or if I do, it won't be for a long time

Look once to me, look once to me
Then look away
Look once to me, then look away

And when they haul me down the hall
And when they kick me down the stairs
I see the faces all lined up before me
Of teachers and of parents and bosses
Who all share a point of view
"You are a loser"
"You are a loser"

Friday, friday mourning
Dressed in black
I won't be coming back
Reflecting from my deathbed
I'm balancing life's riches
against the ditches
and the flat gray years in-between
all I can see are the never-laid
that's the never played symphonies

I can't see those who tried to love me
or those who felt they understood me
and I can't see those who
very patiently put up with me
All I can see are the never-laid
or the never played symphonies

You were one, you meant to be one
and you jumped into my face
and laughed and kissed me on the cheek
and then were gone forever
not quite

Black sky in the daytime
and I don't much mind dying
when there is nothing left to care for anymore
just the never layed
the never played symphonies

You were one, you knew you were one
and you slid right through my fingers
no not literally
but metaphorically
and now you're all I see
as the light fades


My life is an endless succession of people saying goodbye
My life is an endless succession of people saying goodbye
And what's left for me?
What's left for me?

At one time the future it stretched out before me
But now it stretches behind
And all of the best things in life are behind glass
Money, jewelry and flesh
And what's left for me?
What's left for me?

I love you - it's murder

I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to
I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to

I love you - it's pointless
in my soul
If I live or die
this night

I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to
I have two faces
One of which you know
The other one for your sake I never will show

It's just because I love you
I cannot bear to be around you
And if only one or the other
of us would
drop
down
dead

In Mexico
I went for a walk to inhale
the tranquil, cool, lover's air
but I could taste a trace
of American chemical waste
And the small voice said
"What can we do?"

In Mexico
I went for a walk to inhale
the tranquil, cool, lover's air
but I could sense the hate
from the Lone Star state
And a small voice said
"What can we do?"

It seems if you're rich and you're white
you'll be alright
I just don't see why
this should be so
If you're rich and you're white
you'll be alright
I just don't see why
this should be so

In Mexico
I lay on the grass
and I cried my heart out
for want of my love
Oh, for want of my love
Oh, for want of my love

It seems if you're rich and you're white
you think you're so right
I just don't see why
this should be so
If you're rich and you're white
then you'll be OK
I just don't see why
this should be so

In Mexico
I lay on the grass
and I cried my heart out
for want of my love
For want of my love
For want of my love
For want of my love


With the world's fate resting on your shoulders,
You're gonna need someone on your side.
You can't do it by yourself any longer,
You're gonna need someone on your side.

Someone kindly told me that you'd wasted
Eight of nine lives.
Oh, give yourself a break before you break down.
You're gonna need someone on your side.

And here I am!
And here I am!
Well, you don't need to look so pleased.

Day or night, there is no difference,
You're gonna need someone on your side.
Day or night, there is no difference,
You're gonna need someone soon.

And here I am!
And here I am!
Well, you don't need to look so pleased.


First day with the joy you find,
Everyone lies.
First day with the joy you find,
Everyone lies,
Nobody minds,
Everyone lies.
Where is the man you respect?
And where is the woman you love?

Third week with the joy you find,
Everything dies.
"We won't vote Conservative,
Because we never have.",
Everyone lies, everyone lies,
Where is the man you respect?
And where is the woman you love?

Everything of worth,
On earth,
Is there to share

I used to dream and I used to vow,
I wouldn't dream of it now.
We look to Los Angeles
For the language we use
London is dead
London is dead
London is dead
London is dead
London is dead
London is dead
I'm too much in love,
I'm too much in love.

How sad are we ?
And how sad have we been ?
We'll let you know, We'll let you know
Oh, but only if - you're really interested
You wonder how
We've stayed alive 'till now
We'll let you know, We'll let you know
But only if - you're really interested
We're all smiles
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles
That make us hostile
Oh ... We will descend
On anyone unable to defend
Themselves
Oh ... And the songs we sing
They're not supposed to mean a thing
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely
Oh ...
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or
We may even be
The most depressing people you've ever known
At heart, what's left, we sadly know
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know
We are the last truly British people you will ever know
You'll never never want to know

David, the wind blows,
The wind blows
Bits of your life away.
Your friends all say,
"Where is our boy?
Ah, we've lost our boy".
But they should know,
Where you've gone,
Because again and again you've explained
That you're going to . . .
Oh, oh, oh, going to . . .
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
"England for the English",
"England for the English".

David, the wind's blown,
The wind's blown
All of my dreams away.
And I still say,
"Where is our boy?
Ah, we've lost our boy".
But I should know
Why you've gone,
Because again and again you've explained
You're going to the National . . .
Ah, to the National . . .

There's a country,
You don't live there,
But one day you would like to.
And if you show them what you're made of,
Ah, then you might do.

But David, we wonder,
We wonder if the thunder
Is ever really gonna begin,
Begin, begin
You're mum says,
"I've lost my boy".
But she should know
Why you've gone,
Because again and again you've explained
You're going to the National,
To the National,
To the National Front disco,
Because you want the day to come sooner,
You want the day to come sooner,
You want the day to come sooner,
When you've settled the score.

Oh, the National,


I take the cue from
Certain people I know
I use the cue And then I
Hand it on to you
And when I swing it
So, it catches his eye ...
(Weren't you there?
- You'd have died!)
I trust the views of
Certain people I know
They look at Danger
And they
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF
Their clothes are Imitation
George the 23rd
(Don't you find this absurd?)
I'd hate to be like
Certain people I know
They break their necks
And can't afford to
Get them fixed
Ah, they'd sacrifice all
Of their principles for
anything cashable
I do believe it's terrible

We hate it when our friends become successful,
We hate it when our friends become successful.
Oh, look at those clothes,
Now look at that face it's so old,
And such a video,
Well, it's really laughable,
Ah hahahaha etc.

We hate it when our friends become successful,
And if they're northern
That makes it even worse and
If we can destroy them
You bet your life we will destroy them.
If we can hurt them, well,
We may well.
It's really laughable,
Ah hahahaha etc.

You see, it should have been me.
It could have been me.
Everybody knows, everybody says so.
They say, "Oh, you have loads of songs,
So many songs,
More songs than they can stand --
Verse, chorus, middle eighth break"
Just listen,

I am a poor, freezing-cold soul,
So far from where I intended to go.
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls,
So far from where I'm determined to go.

Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love.
There is no way.
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love,
But, you see, I've got no charm.

Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold,
Oh, this is very clear to you.
And you can tell I have never really loved.
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day.

And all of my life no-one gave me anything.
No-one has ever given me anything.
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye.
You must be such a fool to pass me by.

My love,
Wherever you are,
Whatever you are,
Don't lose faith.
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you.
Please wait . . .
Please wait . . .
Ah, ha, ha,
Wait . . .
Don't lose faith.

You say that the day
Just never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away.
Still I know it's gonna happen someday
To you.
Please wait . . .
Don't lose faith

Tomorrow,
Will it really come?
And if it does come,
Will I still be human?

All I ask of you,
Is one thing that you never do,
Would you put your arms around me,
(I won't tell anyone).
Tomorrow,
Does it have to come.

All I ask of you,
Is one thing that you'll never do,
Would you put your arms around me,
(I won't tell anybody).
Tomorrow,
And what must come before...

Oh! The pain in my arms!
Oh! The pain in my legs!
Oh! My shiftless body.

Tomorrow,
It's surely nearer now.

You don't think I'll make it,
I never said I wanted to.
Well, did I?

Oh! the pain in my arms!
Oh! the pain in my legs!
Oh yeah! and oh yeah!
And, Oh yeah! and oh yeah!
Oh! Through my shiftless body.

Tomorrow,
Tomorrow.

All I ask of you, oh, oh-oh,
Is would you tell me that you love me,
Tell me, tell me that you love me.
Tell me, tell me that you love me.
Tell me that you love me.

Oh! I know you don't mean it.
Oh! I know you don't mean it.

Tell me, tell me that you love me.

There's too many people
Planning your downfall
When your spirit's on trial
These nights can be frightening
Sleep transports sadness
To some other mid-brain
And somebody here
Will not be here next year
So you stand by the board
Full of fear and intention
And, if you think that they're listening
Well, you've got to be joking
Oh, you understand change
And you think it's essential
But when your profession
Is humiliation
Say the wrong word to our children...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you
Lay a hand on our children
And it's never too late to have you
Mucus on your collar
A nail up through the staff chair
A blade in your soap
And you cry into your pillow
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief

Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you
Lay a hand on our children
And it's never too late to have you
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief

I'm very glad the spring has come
The sun shines outside bright
The little birds that are on the trees
Are singing for delight

You don't know a thing about their lives
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep
But you write as if you all lie side by side
Reader, meet Author
With the hope of hearing sense
But you may be feeling let down
By the words of defence
He says "No-one ever sees me when I cry"

You don't know a thing about their lives
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives
And if a fight broke out here tonight
You'd be the first away, because you're that type
And the year 2000 won't change anyone here
As each fabled promise flies so fast
You'll swear it was never there
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life?

So safely with your software, all miles from the front line
You hear the way their sad voice sings, and you start to imagine things
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

He's just too good-natured and
He's got too much money and
He's got too many girlfriends
I'm jealous, that's all

Have you seen him go, though, oh?
Have you seen him go, though, oh?

Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

He's got too many girlfriends
He thinks he owns this city
He overspeeds and he never gets pulled over

Have you seen him go, though, oh?
Have you seen him go, though, oh?

Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

He thinks he got the whole world in his hands
Stood at the urinal
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no!

Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

He's just too good-looking
He's just too good-looking
He's just too good-looking, and...

Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

You fight with your right hand
And caress with your left hand
Everyone I know is sick to death of you

With a tear that's a mile wide
In the kite that you're flying
Everyone I know is sick to death of you

Ever since
You don't look the same
You're just not the same, no way
You say clever things and
You never used to

You don't catch what I'm saying
When you're deafened to advice
Everyone here is sick to the
Back teeth of you

With a tear that's a mile wide
In the kite that you're flying
Everyone here is sick to the
Tattoo of you

Ever since
You don't look the same
You're just not the same, no way
You say pleasant things and
There is no need to

Still, you fight with your right hand
And caress with your left hand

Sad to say...
How once I was in love with you
Sad to say...

You don't catch what I'm saying
When you're deafened to advice

Ever since
You don't look the same
You're just not the same, no way
What the hell have
They stuck into you?

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him
I see why

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave
Oh, Dagenham Dave

"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave
Oh, Dagenham Dave

He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust
I could say more, but you get the general idea

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave
Oh, Dagenham Dave


Compare the best of their days
With the worst of your days
You won't win
With your standards so high
And your spirits so low
At least remember ...
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day

Just do your best and don't ...
Don't worry, oh
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair

See the best of how they look
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win
With your standards so high
And your spirits so low
At least remember ...
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress

Just do your best and don't ...
Don't worry, oh
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair

I turn the music down
And I don't know why, this is my house
I turn the music down
And I don't know why, this is my house
The best friend on the payroll
No.. it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out
No..
The best friend on the payroll
Oh, no.. it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out

More breakfast in bed, and I'll bring the paper in later
The best friend on the payroll
Oh, no.. it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out
No..
The best friend on the payroll
Oh, no.. it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out

More breakfast in bed, and I'll bring the paper in later
The best friend on the payroll
No.. it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out
No..
The best friend on the payroll
No.. it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out

You were a boy before
You became a man
I don't see the joy
And you ran with your pals in the sun
You turned around and they were gone
Again...

A sick boy should be treated
So easily defeated
Oh, I just don't understand
So you ran with your pals in the sun
You turned around
You were alone
Again ...
And you ran back to Ma
Which set the pace for the rest of your days
Oh, you ran back to Ma
Which set the pace for the rest of your days
Oh, you ran back to Ma
Which set the pace for the rest of your days

And now, there is something that you should know
There is something that you should know
The girl of your dreams is here all alone
The girl of your dreams is here all alone
The girl of your dreams is
Sad and all alone
The girl of your dreams is
Here all alone
There is something that you should know
There is something that you should know
Girl of your dreams is
Here all alone
The girl of your dreams is
Sad and is all alone
The girl of your dreams is
Sad and is feeling all alone
Oh, there is something that you should know

Help me, help me, help me...
